The move accelerates Sagents vision to improve loan servicing engagement and consumer experience from the homeowner perspective. Udays appointment is one in a series of executive hires by CEO Dan Sogorka. Sagent powers the homeownership and consumer lending experience for 12 million borrowers (and growing), enabling large banks and lenders to give Americas borrowers the same bank-on-your-phone experience they get in every other aspect of their lives. If mortgage originators are the finders of new customers, servicers must be the keepers of those customers, said Sogorka. In addition to being the industrys most modern servicing system of record, Sagent powers lifetime customer engagement and retention for servicers. And Uday is a pioneer of building and running these complex systems at scale. Devalla has led engineering, digital transformation, information security, and regtech strategy in housing for more than two decades. Most recently, Devalla led technology transformation as Chief Information Officer at Stearns Lending, a top mortgage bank that also powers home lending for Americas most prominent fintech challenger bank. Under Devalla, Stearns led digital transformation in U.S. mortgage originations, and now hes bringing that same transformation to servicing. Prior to that, Devalla served as a technology executive at Bank of America (and its predecessor organization Countrywide), where he helped build and run the industrys first non-agency automated underwriting system and proprietary loan origination system. The mortgage servicing tech stack isnt just a system of record to keep lenders efficient, profitable, and compliant, said Devalla. It also must be the lifetime customer engagement and retention platform for customers, providing omnichannel advice and care during good and challenging times. Devalla and Chief Innovation Officer Tim Von Kaenel have already accelerated how Sagents enterprise and consumer suites power Americas largest lenders to care for customers using the most modern technology.

This provides the foundation needed for Coded By Kids to begin to address diversity and inclusion in tech and innovation with long term solutions that are designed to deliver high-quality, sustainable career opportunities for communities of color in Philadelphia. Coded By Kids is a nonprofit organization that provides young people with development, digital design, computer science, and tech startupfocused education programs. OnE Philadelphia, their new initiative, addresses the city\'s focus on short-term solutions to systemic racial inequity. By implementing a citywide tech education effort, OnE Philadelphia\'s mission is to transform the city into a pipeline for high-level tech talent and tech startup leaders. The initiative is driven by three main strategies: creating an integrated tech education, skill development, and experiential learning ecosystem that targets high-growth opportunity careers; building the infrastructure needed to support an integrated ecosystem; and changing the way underrepresented Philadelphians look at tech and innovation in order to change the culture of the city. ""At the heart of my work as founder and CEO of Coded By Kids is my commitment to building one Philadelphia,"" said Sylvester Mobley, founder and CEO, Coded By Kids. ""When you look at our city there are two vastly different realities that Philadelphians experience that are connected to the color of their skin. This outpouring of support we\'ve received from Bank of America, Comcast, and The Lenfest Foundation demonstrates the value this pipeline will add to the city and acknowledges the collaborative effort it will take to make equity and inclusion a priority in the tech and entrepreneurship fields.The launch of OnE Philadelphia is just the beginning. It\'s going to take additional funding commitments from stakeholders around the city to make this successful. This isn\'t a one-time thingthis is an investment in lasting equity in our city."" Bank of America is committed to addressing issues that are fundamentally connected to economic mobility like access to workforce development opportunities to build more sustainable communities. As part of the bank\'s $1 billion, four-year commitment, $10 million was allocated to providing Economic Resiliency Grants to local organizations working to advance racial equality and economic opportunity for communities of color, including Coded By Kids. With these funds in addition to receiving Bank of America\'s Neighborhood Buildersgrant, Coded By Kids is better equipped to launch the long-term initiative and bring access to tech and innovation opportunities to more Philadelphians. ""Our support of OnE Philadelphia is rooted in our commitment to meaningful solutions to advance racial equality and economic mobility in low- to moderate-income populations and communities of color,"" said Jim Dever, Philadelphia market president for Bank of America. ""The work that Sylvester and his team have done so far to put this plan into action is inspiring and it\'s a pleasure to be a part of this transformative workforce readiness initiative."" Comcast has long been committed to addressing digital inequities so that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed in an increasingly digital world. Since 2011, its low-income, high speed broadband adoption program, Internet Essentials, has connected more than 8 millionAmericans to the Internet at home, including more than 288,000 Philadelphians. Beyond connectivity, Comcast is also focused on providing digital skills training to young people and to upskilling adults with the aim of improving economic mobility. Comcast\'s investment in OnE Philadelphia is part of the company\'s multi-year $100 million commitment to fight injustice and inequality and its mission to create a more connected and equitable society. ""Now more than ever, we need to ensure all of Philadelphia\'s residents have the opportunity to thrive in the digital economy,"" said Dalila Wilson-Scott, Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer at Comcast.

We fight systemic inequity by empowering underrepresented young people and ensuring they are equipped with the skills and resources needed to become tech leaders and startup founders. Bank of AmericaAt Bank of America, we\'re guided by a common purpose to help make financial lives better, through the power of every connection. We\'re delivering on this through responsible growth with a focus on our environmental, social and governance (ESG) leadership. ESG is embedded across our eight lines of business and reflects how we help fuel the global economy, build trust and credibility, and represent a company that people want to work for, invest in and do business with. It\'s demonstrated in the inclusive and supportive workplace we create for our employees, the responsible products and services we offer our clients, and the impact we make around the world in helping local economies thrive. An important part of this work is forming strong partnerships with nonprofits and advocacy groups, such as community, consumer and environmental organizations, to bring together our collective networks and expertise to achieve greater impact.

Each year, SAM evaluates more than 7,300 companies around the world, while the plan for 2020 is to evaluate more than 10,000. Furthermore, 2020 saw a record 19% increase in the number of companies actively completing the CSA which consists of a rigorous questionnaire assessing both public and non-public data submitted by participants. Earlier this week, S&P Global announcedthat companies participating in the 2020 CSA will receive access to their S&P Global ESG Scores at the question level for the first time. Earlier this year, the DJSI methodology was updatedto ensure that the indices continue to meet their stated objectives using a best-in-class approach whereby companies are scored based on a range of financially relevant and industry-specific ESG considerations.

Through initial partnerships with 21 higher education institutions including community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), Bank of America is giving $1 million to each of the 21 institutions selected across the U.S. to help students of color successfully complete the education and training necessary to be successful in todays workforce. Career opportunities are a critical pillar in addressing the racial wealth gap in our country, said Bank of America Vice Chairman Anne Finucane. A meaningful job opportunity goes beyond the paycheck it is a pathway to reduce student debt, obtain health care and retirement benefits, and ultimately, build net worth. The collaborative training approach we are taking with this initiative will not only impact the lives of Black and Hispanic-Latino students, but will enable them to make real and meaningful impact in their communities now and in the years ahead. Partner institutions selected so far include: Each partner institution will develop or enhance existing programs to meet specific skill gaps in their communities to create higher-paying, family-sustaining jobs that are in demand. Bank of America will work alongside major employers in each selected market to ensure these programs target specific hiring needs and create a clearly defined career pathway to future employment. As part of this initiative, Bank of America is also partnering with and providing funding to the Aspen Institute, which will collaborate with the National Center for Inquiry and Improvement to convene the participating higher education institutions for technical and programmatic assistance and to share best practices. Were thrilled to work with Bank of America on this initiative to expand employment pathways for Black and Hispanic-Latino students, said Dan Porterfield, president and CEO of the Aspen Institute. Building a learning hub for these colleges will create valuable opportunities to enhance career guidance, employer relationships, financial stability, and peer learning for students all with the goal of helping connect young people to high-wage jobs and reduce racial income and wealth gaps. Today, less than 40% of community college students earn a certificate or degree within six years of enrollment.1 For students of color, graduation and completion rates are particularly low 28.8% for Black students and 37.1% for Hispanic students.2 The ongoing challenges stemming from the coronavirus have exacerbated the financial struggle of HBCUs and HSIs, both public and private, as they seek to serve students from the most vulnerable communities. Bank of America is investing in community colleges, HBCUs, and HSIs in order to increase job opportunities for people of color at a community-based level that will help close the wealth gap and enhance professional career tracks for mid-level candidates.

The conference featured discussions on crop estimates, nutrition, scientific, and marketing topics, as well as three internationally respected keynote speakers.

Hence the need to keep innovating and opening up new markets. Forecasted at 47.3 million MT (in-shell basis), global peanut production is also anticipated to increase by 13%. Although total dried fruit production is estimated slightly below last season, at 3 million MT, along with 2019/20 carry-over, supply should be adequate.

The program will initially be rolled out in seven cities, including Detroit, Dallas, Jacksonville, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Boston and Greater Washington, D.C., through no-cost vouchers distributed by key nonprofit partners that serve households most in need. Underserved communities have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, so supporting flu prevention in these communities is even more important, said Eileen Howard Boone, senior vice president of Corporate Social Responsibility and Philanthropy, CVS Health. Working together with other community-minded companies like Bank of America and our nonprofit partners, we are able to expand our reach to individuals who may not otherwise have access to flu vaccines. Bank of America is also providing a further round of personal protective equipment (PPE), including 5 million additional masks, 2.5 million pairs of gloves and a further 160,000 8-ounce bottles of hand sanitizer to communities most impacted by rising coronavirus cases. This is on top of the 15 million masks and 58,000 8-ounce bottles of hand sanitizer Bank of America has already donated this year to vulnerable and underserved communities. We are committed to working with the public and nonprofit sectors as one global community to address this health crisis and to provide the necessary resources to protect our most vulnerable populations, said Andrew Plepler, head of Environmental, Social and Governance at Bank of America. Offering access to free flu prevention complements our other health-focused efforts including supplying PPE, supporting community-based testing and care, addressing food insecurity and providing access to mental health resources. Bank of Americas work with CVS Health and the companys ongoing PPE donations build on its continued health and health care-focused investments in the communities it serves. This year, the bank has invested more than $100 million in local communities to address coronavirus-related challenges.

The decision is based on data from the Phase 3 E1912 study that showed previously untreated patients aged 70 years or younger treated with ibrutinib plus rituximab lived longer without disease progression than those treated with the established chemo-immunotherapy regimen fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR).2,3 The study was designed and conducted in the United States (U.S.) by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.2,3 The study evaluated 529 previously untreated patients with CLL aged 70 years or younger (median age, 58 years) who were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of ibrutinib plus rituximab (IR) (n=354), followed by ibrutinib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or six cycles of FCR (n=175).2 At a median follow-up of 37 months, patients treated with IR lived longer without disease progression, with a progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 88 percent, compared to 75 percent for patients treated with FCR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.52; p<0.0001).1 The study also showed an overall survival (OS) advantage for patients treated with the IR regimen.1 The primary study results were published previously in The New England Journal of Medicine, and with extended 48-month follow-up, as presented at the 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, the initial treatment benefit is maintained.2,3 Historically, chemotherapy with FCR has been the standard of care, or first treatment prescribed for patients with previously untreated CLL, said John Gribben, MD DSc, Professor of Medical Oncology at St Bartholomew\'s Hospital, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary, University of London. This decision by the EC is an important step in being able to offer patients with CLL a non-chemotherapy option in the frontline setting, building on the established efficacy and safety we have come to expect from ibrutinib-based therapy. We are delighted with the ECs decision approving the use of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab for these patients, said Dr Patrick Laroche, Haematology Therapy Area Lead, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag. This new non-chemotherapy combination regimen can offer extended remission, as well as fewer chemotherapy-related side effects for patients living with CLL. Adverse events for the IR arm were consistent with the known safety profiles for ibrutinib and rituximab.1 The most common adverse reactions seen with ibrutinib include diarrhoea, neutropaenia, musculoskeletal pain, rash, haemorrhage (e.g., bruising), thrombocytopenia, nausea, pyrexia, arthralgia, and upper respiratory tract infection.4 The most common serious adverse reactions (which may affect more than 1 in 20 people) include neutropenia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, and hypertension.4 Ibrutinib is the most comprehensively studied Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor with the longest follow-up across eight positive Phase 3 trials in CLL to date, and is recognised as an important advancement in treatment for patients with CLL, said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. This latest milestone highlights our commitment to studying the full potential of ibrutinib and in developing regimens which can transform what a CLL diagnosis means for patients going forward. This announcement comes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) approval of this expanded indication for ibrutinib in April 2020. #ENDS# About ibrutinib Ibrutinib is a once-a-day, first-in-class Bruton\'s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that is administered orally.4 Ibrutinib blocks the BTK protein; the BTK protein sends important signals that tell B cells to mature and produce antibodies. BTK signalling is needed by specific cancer cells to multiply and spread.5 By blocking BTK, ibrutinib may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.6 Indications for which ibrutinib is approved in Europe include:4 Ibrutinib is approved in more than 99 countries for at least one indication, and to date, has been used to treat more than 200,000 patients worldwide.7 For a full list of side effects and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using ibrutinib please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for further information. About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is typically a slow-growing blood cancer of the white blood cells.8 The overall incidence of CLL in Europe is approximately 4.92 cases per 100,000 persons per year and is about 1.5 times more common in men than in women.9 CLL is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with a median age of 72 years at diagnosis.10 The disease eventually progresses in the majority of patients, and they are faced with fewer treatment options with each relapse. Patients are often prescribed multiple lines of therapy as they relapse or become resistant to treatments. About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past. Were the Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, working tirelessly to make that future a reality for patients everywhere by fighting sickness with science, improving access with ingenuity, and healing hopelessness with heart.

The market is projected to grow with a CAGR of 10.2% from 2019 to 2027.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05974402/?utm_source=PRN The pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing market is growing primarily due to the advantages offered by continuous manufacturing process.However, high capital investment is likely to hamper the growth of the market in the coming years.On the other hand, increasing R&D spending is expected to have a positive impact on the growth of the North American pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing market in the coming years.Continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry is a result of advancements in technology with respect to the production techniques.The batch manufacturing method was traditionally followed in the pharmaceutical industry.However, the development in technology has accelerated mass production with improved quality, and it has addressed the many primary causes such as the recall of drugs and recalls. The pharmaceutical industry has recently begun to implement the continuous manufacturing process as an option to improve and sustain manufacturing operations.Batch manufacturing has been the most common and traditional mode of manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry for more than a century.However, with the rising demand for biologics and increasing trend of contract manufacturing, the flexible manufacturing alternatives such as continuous manufacturing processes are being embraced and gaining importance in the recent years.The FDA is passing quick approvals to companies transitioning from batch production to continuous manufacturing procedures.In 2016, Orkambi by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was the first manufacturer to go ""batch-less"" on their production lines.Further, in April 2019 Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. switched to continuous manufacturing process for the development of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) owing to the advantages offered by this process in terms of streamlining the manufacturing procedure, ability to accelerate procedure, and others. Continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing involves a drug taken from its base ingredients to final product with no need of halt or stop during the production. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry wastes up to $50 billion every year on inefficient processes. Continuous manufacturing serves to be a potential solution for the same problem. Additionally, there are various other advantages offered by the continuous manufacturing process, such as time-efficiency, reduced energy needs, increased productivity, and reduction in overall wastage amounts.Moreover, the risk of human error is also reduced in the continuous manufacturing process due to the involvement of minimum number of people in the manufacturing process. Thus, the advantages offered by continuous manufacturing over batch manufacturing procedure are expected to drive the growth of the market over the coming years.The infections of COVID-19 has killed thousands and rising exponentially in the region.The US is one of the biggest markets for new product developments, along with the adoption of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing processes in the companies.Pharmaceutical supplies and procurement are also severely affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 in North America. The COVID-19 outbreak highlights potential vulnerabilities in both our drug supply chain and our clinical infrastructure, including the availability of adequate clinician resources.In terms of product, the integrated systems segment accounted for the largest share of the North American pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing market in 2019 and is estimated to mark the highest CAGR in the market during the forecast period, owing to the factors such as their easy availability and accessibility as well as higher adoption of these systems compared to the semi-continuous systems and the controls. Also, the convenience of use of upright freezers has led to its dominance during 2019 and is expected to witness similar trend over the coming years.Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and World Health Organization (WHO) are among the significant primary and secondary sources for pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing included in the report.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05974402/?utm_source=PRN About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

In patients with PAH, interruptions in treatment should be avoided due to the progressive nature of the disease.1 UPTRAVI is a selective, prostacyclin IP receptor agonist. Oral UPTRAVI was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment of PAH to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization.2 ""Even relatively short-term PAH treatment interruptions due to a temporary inability to take oral medication, like during surgery, can have a significant negative impact on a person\'s health,"" said Neil Davie, Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Pulmonary Hypertension, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""We have demonstrated that continued treatment with UPTRAVI can significantly improve patients\' long-term outcomes. Preventing an interruption of treatment with an IV formulation is an important therapeutic option and we are pleased to be one step closer to bringing this important treatment to the PAH community."" The NDA is based on the prospective, multi-center Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of patients with PAH temporarily switching from oral UPTRAVI to UPTRAVI IV, and then transitioning back to the initial oral dose. Results showed that UPTRAVI IV is suitable to maintain continuous dosing for short periods of time when oral administration of UPTRAVI is not feasible.1 About the UPTRAVI IV Study1 The UPTRAVI IV study (NCT03187678) was a prospective, multi-center, open-label single-sequence crossover, Phase 3 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of temporarily switching between oral UPTRAVI and UPTRAVI IV. The study examined a stable dose of UPTRAVI tablets to a corresponding dose of UPTRAVI for injection and switching back to UPTRAVI tablets. The treatment and observation phase was divided into 3 periods. In Period 1, patients received their stable oral dose of UPTRAVI twice daily (morning and evening of Day 1). In Period 2, patients received three infusions of corresponding UPTRAVI IV doses (morning and evening of Day 2, and morning of Day 3). In Period 3, patients resumed their stable oral UPTRAVI dose twice daily in the evening of Day 3 for 9 days, which was continued through the safety follow-up. Patients were hospitalized during Periods 1 and 2. All 20 enrolled patients completed the study as planned and received all UPTRAVI doses (oral or IV). The switch between oral UPTRAVI and UPTRAVI IV was well tolerated, and there were no unexpected safety findings. Adverse reactions that resulted from UPTRAVI for injection were similar to those associated with UPTRAVI tablets, with the exception of infusion site reaction. Prostacyclin-associated adverse events included headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pain in jaw, myalgia, pain in extremity, flushing and arthralgia.1 IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION2 INDICATION UPTRAVI (selexipag) is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization for PAH. Effectiveness was established in a long-term study in PAH patients with WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms. Patients had idiopathic and heritable PAH (58%), PAH associated with connective tissue disease (29%), and PAH associated with congenital heart disease with repaired shunts (10%). CONTRAINDICATIONS Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (eg, gemfibrozil) with UPTRAVI is contraindicated. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD) Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue UPTRAVI. ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions more frequent compared to placebo (3%) are headache (65% vs 32%), diarrhea (42% vs 18%), jaw pain (26% vs 6%), nausea (33% vs 18%), myalgia (16% vs 6%), vomiting (18% vs 9%), pain in extremity (17% vs 8%), flushing (12% vs 5%), arthralgia (11% vs 8%), anemia (8% vs 5%), decreased appetite (6% vs 3%), and rash (11% vs 8%). These adverse reactions are more frequent during the dose titration phase. Hyperthyroidism was observed in 1% (n=8) of patients on UPTRAVI and in none of the patients on placebo. DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP2C8 Inhibitors Concomitant administration with gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, doubled exposure to selexipag and increased exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 11-fold. Concomitant use of UPTRAVI with strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 is contraindicated. Concomitant administration of UPTRAVI with clopidogrel, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8, had no relevant effect on the exposure to selexipag and increased the exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 2.7fold. Reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily in patients on a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor. CYP2C8 Inducers Concomitant administration with an inducer of CYP2C8 and UGT 1A3 and 2B7 enzymes (rifampin) halved exposure to the active metabolite. Increase UPTRAVI dose, up to twice, when co-administered with rifampin. Reduce UPTRAVI when rifampin is stopped. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage Recommended starting dose is 200 mcg twice daily. Tolerability may be improved when taken with food. Increase by 200 mcg twice daily, usually at weekly intervals, to the highest tolerated dose up to 1600 mcg twice daily. If dose is not tolerated, reduce to the previous tolerated dose. Patients With Hepatic Impairment For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the starting dose is 200 mcg once daily. Increase by 200 mcg once daily at weekly intervals, as tolerated. Avoid use of UPTRAVI in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Co-administration With Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors When co-administered with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel, deferasirox and teriflunomide), reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily. Revert back to twice daily dosing frequency of UPTRAVI when co-administration of moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor is stopped. Dosage Strengths UPTRAVI tablet strengths: 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 mcg. Please see full Prescribing Information. About Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) PAH is a specific form of PH that causes the walls of the pulmonary arteries (blood vessels leading from the right side of the heart to the lungs) to become thick and stiff, narrowing the space for blood to flow, and causing an increased blood pressure to develop within the lungs. PAH is a serious, progressive disease with a variety of etiologies and has a major impact on patients\' functioning as well as their physical, psychological and social wellbeing. There is currently no cure for PH and it is often fatal.3,4,5 However, the last decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PAH, transforming the prognosis for PAH patients from symptomatic improvements in exercise tolerance 10 years ago, to delayed disease progression today.

Data Supporting Approval The approval was based on results from the GO-VIVA Phase 3 clinical trial, an open-label study in children with JIA with active polyarthritis ages 2 to 17 years who had active arthritis in five or more joints, despite receiving treatment with methotrexate for at least two months. Trial results demonstrated that pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure of SIMPONI ARIA was consistent with that of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of SIMPONI ARIA in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA and active PsA. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in adult patients with RA. The adverse reactions observed in GO-VIVA were consistent with the established safety profile of SIMPONI ARIA in adult patients with RA and PsA. ""Due to the limited availability of pediatric patients for inclusion in clinical trials, it can be challenging to build clinical studies for this young patient population,"" said Daniel J. Lovell, the Joseph E. Levinson Professor of Pediatric Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital Medical Center. ""Given these challenges, I am pleased to see Janssen advance the approval of a new treatment option for pediatric patients with pJIA and PsA an important milestone in the treatment of these complex, heterogeneous diseases."" Access to SIMPONI ARIA Janssen strives to work closely with payers, providers and pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to help ensure SIMPONI ARIA is broadly accessible to appropriate patients. JanssenCarePathoffers a comprehensive support program that helps patients get started on SIMPONI ARIA and stay on track. Janssen CarePath provides information on insurance coverage, potential out-of-pocket costs and treatment support, and identifies options that may help make treatment more affordable, including the Janssen CarePath Savings Program for commercially insured patients who are eligible. About the GO-VIVA Clinical Trial GO-VIVA is a Phase 3, open-label, single arm, multicenter study conducted across nine countries with treatment received by 127 patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, despite current treatment with methotrexate. GO-VIVA was conducted as a post-marketing requirement under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) following the initial approval of SIMPONI ARIA for adults with moderately to severely active RA in 2013. GO-VIVA was designed to evaluate the dosing of SIMPONI ARIA in children that is required to achieve drug levels and exposures that are similar to those that were shown to be safe and effective in adults with moderately to severely active RA, since active pJIA, active PsA in pediatric patients, and adult RA show similarities in disease. About SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) In addition to the treatment of children ages 2 years and olderwith active pJIA or active PsA, SIMPONI ARIA is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA, active PsA and active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). SIMPONI ARIA is currently approved for one or more of these indications in 24 countries. SIMPONI ARIA is a fully human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody that targets both soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-alpha, a protein that when overproduced in the body due to chronic inflammatory diseases can cause inflammation. For adults withRA, PsA, and AS,the SIMPONI ARIA weight-based dosage regimen is 2 mg/kg given as an IV infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. SIMPONI ARIA is given with methotrexate for the treatment of RA. For pediatric patients with pJIA and PsA, the SIMPONI ARIA body surface area (BSA)-based dosage regimen is 80 mg/m2 given as an IV infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, andevery 8 weeks thereafter. More information about SIMPONI ARIA is available at www.SimponiARIA.com. Janssen Biotech, Inc. discovered and developed SIMPONI ARIA. What is SIMPONI ARIA(golimumab)? SIMPONI ARIA is a prescription medicine used to treat: Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults, used in combination with methotrexate Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in people 2 years of age and older Active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults Active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION SERIOUS INFECTIONS SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) is a prescription medicine. SIMPONI ARIA can lower your ability to fight infections. There are reports of serious infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that have spread throughout the body, including tuberculosis (TB) and histoplasmosis. Some of these infections have been fatal. Your doctor will test you for TB before starting SIMPONI ARIA and will closely monitor you for signs of TB during treatment. Tell your doctor if you have been in close contact with people with TB. Tell your doctor if you have been in a region (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys and the Southwest) where certain fungal infections like histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis are common. You should not receive SIMPONI ARIAif you have any kind of infection. Tell your doctor if you are prone to or have a history of infections or have diabetes, HIV or a weak immune system. You should also tell your doctor if you are currently being treated for an infection or if you have or develop any signs of an infection such as: fever, sweat, or chills muscle aches cough shortness of breath blood in phlegm weight loss warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body diarrhea or stomach pain burning when you urinate or urinate more than normal feel very tired Your doctor will examine you for TB and perform a test to see if you have TB. If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicine for TB before you begin treatment with SIMPONI ARIA and during treatment with SIMPONI ARIA. Even if your TB test is negative, your doctor should carefully monitor you for TB infections while you are taking SIMPONI ARIA. People who had a negative TB skin test before receiving SIMPONI ARIA have developed active TB. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms while taking or after taking SIMPONI ARIA: cough that does not go away low grade fever weight loss loss of body fat and muscle (wasting) CANCER Unusual cancers have been reported in children and teenage patients taking Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blocker medicines. For children and adults receiving TNF blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA, the chances for getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare and fatal lymphoma, has occurred mostly in teenage or young adult males with Crohn\'s disease or ulcerative colitis who were taking a TNF blocker with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. You should tell your doctor if you have had or develop lymphoma or other cancers. Some people treated with SIMPONI ARIAdeveloped skin cancer. Tell your doctor if any changes in the appearance of your skin or growths on your skin occur during or after your treatment with SIMPONI ARIA.Your doctor should periodically examine your skin, especially if you have a history of skin cancer.

The firm garnered the largest jury award on the prestigious list for a $4.69 billion verdict in Missouri state court in July 2018 on behalf of 22 women alleging that their frequent use of Johnson & Johnson\'s talc-based powders led to ovarian cancer. Although subsequently reduced to a $2.1 billion award by an appellate court for certain jurisdictional reasons, Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson still ranks as the nation\'s largest in the wrongful death litigation category during this time period. The firm also secured the third-, fourth- and eighth-largest jury awards between 2015 and 2019 in the category of product liability. Each verdict stemmed from bellwether trials in federal multidistrict litigation in the Northern District of Texas and were based on the claims of individuals who suffered a variety of debilitating physical problems after receiving metal-on-metal hip implants manufactured by DePuy Orthopaedics Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. The cases are Metzler v. Depuy, in which the jury awarded $1.04 billion to six plaintiffs in December 2016; Greer v. Depuy, in which the jury awarded $502 million to five plaintiffs in March 2016; and a $247 million verdict on behalf of six plaintiffs in Alicea v. Depuy in November 2017. In each of the trials, plaintiffs alleged that the devices, marketed under the Pinnacle brand, had unreasonably high failure rates resulting in severe pain and inflammation, bone erosion, tissue loss and other problems. The victims further claimed that DePuy\'s design was defective; the company failed to give adequate warnings; and Johnson & Johnson aided and abetted in misrepresentations that rose to the level of fraud.

The global immunosuppressant drugs market is expected to display a positive market trend over the forecast period of 2019-2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.00%. The growing demand for organ transplantation and the rise in the number of autoimmune disorders are the primary factors fueling the growth of this market. A malfunctioning of the immune system results in it attacking the healthy cells, tissues, and organs. Thus, immunosuppressants are used in this case to weaken the immune system. Furthermore, there is a huge demand for these drugs from growing countries. Also, the exports of drugs and medicine around the world are on the rise. However, immunosuppressant drugs cause side-effects, which is negatively affecting their demand. This is a major restraining factor for market growth. Besides, the lack of awareness about organ donation is creating hurdles in the path of market growth.

In patients with PAH, interruptions in treatment should be avoided due to the progressive nature of the disease.1 UPTRAVI is a selective, prostacyclin IP receptor agonist. Oral UPTRAVI was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment of PAH to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization.2 ""Even relatively short-term PAH treatment interruptions due to a temporary inability to take oral medication, like during surgery, can have a significant negative impact on a person\'s health,"" said Neil Davie, Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Pulmonary Hypertension, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""We have demonstrated that continued treatment with UPTRAVI can significantly improve patients\' long-term outcomes. Preventing an interruption of treatment with an IV formulation is an important therapeutic option and we are pleased to be one step closer to bringing this important treatment to the PAH community."" The NDA is based on the prospective, multi-center Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of patients with PAH temporarily switching from oral UPTRAVI to UPTRAVI IV, and then transitioning back to the initial oral dose. Results showed that UPTRAVI IV is suitable to maintain continuous dosing for short periods of time when oral administration of UPTRAVI is not feasible.1 About the UPTRAVI IV Study1 The UPTRAVI IV study (NCT03187678) was a prospective, multi-center, open-label single-sequence crossover, Phase 3 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of temporarily switching between oral UPTRAVI and UPTRAVI IV. The study examined a stable dose of UPTRAVI tablets to a corresponding dose of UPTRAVI for injection and switching back to UPTRAVI tablets. The treatment and observation phase was divided into 3 periods. In Period 1, patients received their stable oral dose of UPTRAVI twice daily (morning and evening of Day 1). In Period 2, patients received three infusions of corresponding UPTRAVI IV doses (morning and evening of Day 2, and morning of Day 3). In Period 3, patients resumed their stable oral UPTRAVI dose twice daily in the evening of Day 3 for 9 days, which was continued through the safety follow-up. Patients were hospitalized during Periods 1 and 2. All 20 enrolled patients completed the study as planned and received all UPTRAVI doses (oral or IV). The switch between oral UPTRAVI and UPTRAVI IV was well tolerated, and there were no unexpected safety findings. Adverse reactions that resulted from UPTRAVI for injection were similar to those associated with UPTRAVI tablets, with the exception of infusion site reaction. Prostacyclin-associated adverse events included headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pain in jaw, myalgia, pain in extremity, flushing and arthralgia.1 IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION2 INDICATION UPTRAVI (selexipag) is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization for PAH. Effectiveness was established in a long-term study in PAH patients with WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms. Patients had idiopathic and heritable PAH (58%), PAH associated with connective tissue disease (29%), and PAH associated with congenital heart disease with repaired shunts (10%). CONTRAINDICATIONS Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (eg, gemfibrozil) with UPTRAVI is contraindicated. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD) Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue UPTRAVI. ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions more frequent compared to placebo (3%) are headache (65% vs 32%), diarrhea (42% vs 18%), jaw pain (26% vs 6%), nausea (33% vs 18%), myalgia (16% vs 6%), vomiting (18% vs 9%), pain in extremity (17% vs 8%), flushing (12% vs 5%), arthralgia (11% vs 8%), anemia (8% vs 5%), decreased appetite (6% vs 3%), and rash (11% vs 8%). These adverse reactions are more frequent during the dose titration phase. Hyperthyroidism was observed in 1% (n=8) of patients on UPTRAVI and in none of the patients on placebo. DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP2C8 Inhibitors Concomitant administration with gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, doubled exposure to selexipag and increased exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 11-fold. Concomitant use of UPTRAVI with strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 is contraindicated. Concomitant administration of UPTRAVI with clopidogrel, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8, had no relevant effect on the exposure to selexipag and increased the exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 2.7fold. Reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily in patients on a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor. CYP2C8 Inducers Concomitant administration with an inducer of CYP2C8 and UGT 1A3 and 2B7 enzymes (rifampin) halved exposure to the active metabolite. Increase UPTRAVI dose, up to twice, when co-administered with rifampin. Reduce UPTRAVI when rifampin is stopped. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage Recommended starting dose is 200 mcg twice daily. Tolerability may be improved when taken with food. Increase by 200 mcg twice daily, usually at weekly intervals, to the highest tolerated dose up to 1600 mcg twice daily. If dose is not tolerated, reduce to the previous tolerated dose. Patients With Hepatic Impairment For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the starting dose is 200 mcg once daily. Increase by 200 mcg once daily at weekly intervals, as tolerated. Avoid use of UPTRAVI in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Co-administration With Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors When co-administered with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel, deferasirox and teriflunomide), reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily. Revert back to twice daily dosing frequency of UPTRAVI when co-administration of moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor is stopped. Dosage Strengths UPTRAVI tablet strengths: 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 mcg. Please see full Prescribing Information. About Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) PAH is a specific form of PH that causes the walls of the pulmonary arteries (blood vessels leading from the right side of the heart to the lungs) to become thick and stiff, narrowing the space for blood to flow, and causing an increased blood pressure to develop within the lungs. PAH is a serious, progressive disease with a variety of etiologies and has a major impact on patients\' functioning as well as their physical, psychological and social wellbeing. There is currently no cure for PH and it is often fatal.3,4,5 However, the last decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PAH, transforming the prognosis for PAH patients from symptomatic improvements in exercise tolerance 10 years ago, to delayed disease progression today.

SOURCE Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies Related Links https://www.janssen.com', 'HORSHAM,Pa., Sept. 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) for patients 2 years of age and older for the treatment of active pJIA and has extended the PsA indication for this same patient population. ""This latest FDA approval of SIMPONI ARIA for pediatric use inactivepJIA and active PsA not only brings a new option to young patients living with these diseases but also adds to the growing body of evidence for this treatment,"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. ""For more than 20 years, we at Janssen have been committed to researching anti-TNF biologic agents for immune-mediated diseases and are encouraged to expand treatment options for these patients."" AboutpJIA and PsA JIA is a group of disorders characterized by arthritis persisting for at least six weeks before the age of 16 years.i Approximately 300,000 children suffer from some form of JIA in the United States.ii The polyarticular form of JIA is most common and is characterized by inflammation in more than four joints and resembles adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA).iii PsA in pediatric patients is one of the rarest subtypes of JIA and is characterized by both joint inflammation and skin lesions associated with psoriasis resembling adult PsA.iv,v Given the heterogeneity of these diseases, additional treatment options are needed for these conditions. ""For far too long, children with pJIA or PsA have had limited treatment options,"" said Seth D. Ginsberg, Co-Founder and President of the Global Healthy Living Foundation and CreakyJoints. ""This approval represents an important step forward for these children and their families."" Data Supporting Approval The approval was based on results from the GO-VIVA Phase 3 clinical trial, an open-label study in children with JIA with active polyarthritis ages 2 to 17 years who had active arthritis in five or more joints, despite receiving treatment with methotrexate for at least two months. Trial results demonstrated that pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure of SIMPONI ARIA was consistent with that of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of SIMPONI ARIA in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA and active PsA. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in adult patients with RA. The adverse reactions observed in GO-VIVA were consistent with the established safety profile of SIMPONI ARIA in adult patients with RA and PsA. ""Due to the limited availability of pediatric patients for inclusion in clinical trials, it can be challenging to build clinical studies for this young patient population,"" said Daniel J. Lovell, the Joseph E. Levinson Professor of Pediatric Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital Medical Center. ""Given these challenges, I am pleased to see Janssen advance the approval of a new treatment option for pediatric patients with pJIA and PsA an important milestone in the treatment of these complex, heterogeneous diseases."" Access to SIMPONI ARIA Janssen strives to work closely with payers, providers and pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to help ensure SIMPONI ARIA is broadly accessible to appropriate patients. JanssenCarePathoffers a comprehensive support program that helps patients get started on SIMPONI ARIA and stay on track. Janssen CarePath provides information on insurance coverage, potential out-of-pocket costs and treatment support, and identifies options that may help make treatment more affordable, including the Janssen CarePath Savings Program for commercially insured patients who are eligible. About the GO-VIVA Clinical Trial GO-VIVA is a Phase 3, open-label, single arm, multicenter study conducted across nine countries with treatment received by 127 patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, despite current treatment with methotrexate. GO-VIVA was conducted as a post-marketing requirement under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) following the initial approval of SIMPONI ARIA for adults with moderately to severely active RA in 2013. GO-VIVA was designed to evaluate the dosing of SIMPONI ARIA in children that is required to achieve drug levels and exposures that are similar to those that were shown to be safe and effective in adults with moderately to severely active RA, since active pJIA, active PsA in pediatric patients, and adult RA show similarities in disease. About SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) In addition to the treatment of children ages 2 years and olderwith active pJIA or active PsA, SIMPONI ARIA is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA, active PsA and active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). SIMPONI ARIA is currently approved for one or more of these indications in 24 countries. SIMPONI ARIA is a fully human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody that targets both soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-alpha, a protein that when overproduced in the body due to chronic inflammatory diseases can cause inflammation. For adults withRA, PsA, and AS,the SIMPONI ARIA weight-based dosage regimen is 2 mg/kg given as an IV infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. SIMPONI ARIA is given with methotrexate for the treatment of RA. For pediatric patients with pJIA and PsA, the SIMPONI ARIA body surface area (BSA)-based dosage regimen is 80 mg/m2 given as an IV infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, andevery 8 weeks thereafter. More information about SIMPONI ARIA is available at www.SimponiARIA.com. Janssen Biotech, Inc. discovered and developed SIMPONI ARIA. What is SIMPONI ARIA(golimumab)? SIMPONI ARIA is a prescription medicine used to treat: Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults, used in combination with methotrexate Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in people 2 years of age and older Active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults Active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION SERIOUS INFECTIONS SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) is a prescription medicine.

The market is projected to grow with a CAGR of 10.2% from 2019 to 2027.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05974402/?utm_source=PRN The pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing market is growing primarily due to the advantages offered by continuous manufacturing process.However, high capital investment is likely to hamper the growth of the market in the coming years.On the other hand, increasing R&D spending is expected to have a positive impact on the growth of the North American pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing market in the coming years.Continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry is a result of advancements in technology with respect to the production techniques.The batch manufacturing method was traditionally followed in the pharmaceutical industry.However, the development in technology has accelerated mass production with improved quality, and it has addressed the many primary causes such as the recall of drugs and recalls. The pharmaceutical industry has recently begun to implement the continuous manufacturing process as an option to improve and sustain manufacturing operations.Batch manufacturing has been the most common and traditional mode of manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry for more than a century.However, with the rising demand for biologics and increasing trend of contract manufacturing, the flexible manufacturing alternatives such as continuous manufacturing processes are being embraced and gaining importance in the recent years.The FDA is passing quick approvals to companies transitioning from batch production to continuous manufacturing procedures.In 2016, Orkambi by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was the first manufacturer to go ""batch-less"" on their production lines.Further, in April 2019 Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. switched to continuous manufacturing process for the development of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) owing to the advantages offered by this process in terms of streamlining the manufacturing procedure, ability to accelerate procedure, and others. Continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing involves a drug taken from its base ingredients to final product with no need of halt or stop during the production. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry wastes up to $50 billion every year on inefficient processes. Continuous manufacturing serves to be a potential solution for the same problem. Additionally, there are various other advantages offered by the continuous manufacturing process, such as time-efficiency, reduced energy needs, increased productivity, and reduction in overall wastage amounts.Moreover, the risk of human error is also reduced in the continuous manufacturing process due to the involvement of minimum number of people in the manufacturing process. Thus, the advantages offered by continuous manufacturing over batch manufacturing procedure are expected to drive the growth of the market over the coming years.The infections of COVID-19 has killed thousands and rising exponentially in the region.The US is one of the biggest markets for new product developments, along with the adoption of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing processes in the companies.Pharmaceutical supplies and procurement are also severely affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 in North America. The COVID-19 outbreak highlights potential vulnerabilities in both our drug supply chain and our clinical infrastructure, including the availability of adequate clinician resources.In terms of product, the integrated systems segment accounted for the largest share of the North American pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing market in 2019 and is estimated to mark the highest CAGR in the market during the forecast period, owing to the factors such as their easy availability and accessibility as well as higher adoption of these systems compared to the semi-continuous systems and the controls. Also, the convenience of use of upright freezers has led to its dominance during 2019 and is expected to witness similar trend over the coming years.Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and World Health Organization (WHO) are among the significant primary and secondary sources for pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing included in the report.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05974402/?utm_source=PRN About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

The firm garnered the largest jury award on the prestigious list for a $4.69 billion verdict in Missouri state court in July 2018 on behalf of 22 women alleging that their frequent use of Johnson & Johnson\'s talc-based powders led to ovarian cancer. Although subsequently reduced to a $2.1 billion award by an appellate court for certain jurisdictional reasons, Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson still ranks as the nation\'s largest in the wrongful death litigation category during this time period. The firm also secured the third-, fourth- and eighth-largest jury awards between 2015 and 2019 in the category of product liability. Each verdict stemmed from bellwether trials in federal multidistrict litigation in the Northern District of Texas and were based on the claims of individuals who suffered a variety of debilitating physical problems after receiving metal-on-metal hip implants manufactured by DePuy Orthopaedics Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. The cases are Metzler v. Depuy, in which the jury awarded $1.04 billion to six plaintiffs in December 2016; Greer v. Depuy, in which the jury awarded $502 million to five plaintiffs in March 2016; and a $247 million verdict on behalf of six plaintiffs in Alicea v. Depuy in November 2017. In each of the trials, plaintiffs alleged that the devices, marketed under the Pinnacle brand, had unreasonably high failure rates resulting in severe pain and inflammation, bone erosion, tissue loss and other problems. The victims further claimed that DePuy\'s design was defective; the company failed to give adequate warnings; and Johnson & Johnson aided and abetted in misrepresentations that rose to the level of fraud.

Methodology & Scope For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/p9oeb', 'SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Sept. 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnsontoday announcedthe submission ofa New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for UPTRAVI (selexipag) as an injection for intravenous (IV) usefor the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) in adults withWHO functional class (FC) IIIII, who are currently prescribed oral UPTRAVI but are temporarily unable to take oral therapy. In patients with PAH, interruptions in treatment should be avoided due to the progressive nature of the disease.1 UPTRAVI is a selective, prostacyclin IP receptor agonist. Oral UPTRAVI was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment of PAH to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization.2 ""Even relatively short-term PAH treatment interruptions due to a temporary inability to take oral medication, like during surgery, can have a significant negative impact on a person\'s health,"" said Neil Davie, Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Pulmonary Hypertension, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""We have demonstrated that continued treatment with UPTRAVI can significantly improve patients\' long-term outcomes. Preventing an interruption of treatment with an IV formulation is an important therapeutic option and we are pleased to be one step closer to bringing this important treatment to the PAH community."" The NDA is based on the prospective, multi-center Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of patients with PAH temporarily switching from oral UPTRAVI to UPTRAVI IV, and then transitioning back to the initial oral dose. Results showed that UPTRAVI IV is suitable to maintain continuous dosing for short periods of time when oral administration of UPTRAVI is not feasible.1 About the UPTRAVI IV Study1 The UPTRAVI IV study (NCT03187678) was a prospective, multi-center, open-label single-sequence crossover, Phase 3 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of temporarily switching between oral UPTRAVI and UPTRAVI IV. The study examined a stable dose of UPTRAVI tablets to a corresponding dose of UPTRAVI for injection and switching back to UPTRAVI tablets. The treatment and observation phase was divided into 3 periods. In Period 1, patients received their stable oral dose of UPTRAVI twice daily (morning and evening of Day 1). In Period 2, patients received three infusions of corresponding UPTRAVI IV doses (morning and evening of Day 2, and morning of Day 3). In Period 3, patients resumed their stable oral UPTRAVI dose twice daily in the evening of Day 3 for 9 days, which was continued through the safety follow-up. Patients were hospitalized during Periods 1 and 2. All 20 enrolled patients completed the study as planned and received all UPTRAVI doses (oral or IV). The switch between oral UPTRAVI and UPTRAVI IV was well tolerated, and there were no unexpected safety findings. Adverse reactions that resulted from UPTRAVI for injection were similar to those associated with UPTRAVI tablets, with the exception of infusion site reaction. Prostacyclin-associated adverse events included headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pain in jaw, myalgia, pain in extremity, flushing and arthralgia.1 IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION2 INDICATION UPTRAVI (selexipag) is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization for PAH. Effectiveness was established in a long-term study in PAH patients with WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms. Patients had idiopathic and heritable PAH (58%), PAH associated with connective tissue disease (29%), and PAH associated with congenital heart disease with repaired shunts (10%). CONTRAINDICATIONS Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (eg, gemfibrozil) with UPTRAVI is contraindicated. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD) Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue UPTRAVI. ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions more frequent compared to placebo (3%) are headache (65% vs 32%), diarrhea (42% vs 18%), jaw pain (26% vs 6%), nausea (33% vs 18%), myalgia (16% vs 6%), vomiting (18% vs 9%), pain in extremity (17% vs 8%), flushing (12% vs 5%), arthralgia (11% vs 8%), anemia (8% vs 5%), decreased appetite (6% vs 3%), and rash (11% vs 8%). These adverse reactions are more frequent during the dose titration phase. Hyperthyroidism was observed in 1% (n=8) of patients on UPTRAVI and in none of the patients on placebo. DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP2C8 Inhibitors Concomitant administration with gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, doubled exposure to selexipag and increased exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 11-fold. Concomitant use of UPTRAVI with strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 is contraindicated. Concomitant administration of UPTRAVI with clopidogrel, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8, had no relevant effect on the exposure to selexipag and increased the exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 2.7fold. Reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily in patients on a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor. CYP2C8 Inducers Concomitant administration with an inducer of CYP2C8 and UGT 1A3 and 2B7 enzymes (rifampin) halved exposure to the active metabolite. Increase UPTRAVI dose, up to twice, when co-administered with rifampin. Reduce UPTRAVI when rifampin is stopped. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage Recommended starting dose is 200 mcg twice daily. Tolerability may be improved when taken with food. Increase by 200 mcg twice daily, usually at weekly intervals, to the highest tolerated dose up to 1600 mcg twice daily. If dose is not tolerated, reduce to the previous tolerated dose. Patients With Hepatic Impairment For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the starting dose is 200 mcg once daily. Increase by 200 mcg once daily at weekly intervals, as tolerated. Avoid use of UPTRAVI in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Co-administration With Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors When co-administered with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel, deferasirox and teriflunomide), reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily. Revert back to twice daily dosing frequency of UPTRAVI when co-administration of moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor is stopped. Dosage Strengths UPTRAVI tablet strengths: 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 mcg. Please see full Prescribing Information. About Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) PAH is a specific form of PH that causes the walls of the pulmonary arteries (blood vessels leading from the right side of the heart to the lungs) to become thick and stiff, narrowing the space for blood to flow, and causing an increased blood pressure to develop within the lungs. PAH is a serious, progressive disease with a variety of etiologies and has a major impact on patients\' functioning as well as their physical, psychological and social wellbeing. There is currently no cure for PH and it is often fatal.3,4,5 However, the last decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PAH, transforming the prognosis for PAH patients from symptomatic improvements in exercise tolerance 10 years ago, to delayed disease progression today.

SOURCE Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies Related Links https://www.janssen.com', 'HORSHAM,Pa., Sept. 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) for patients 2 years of age and older for the treatment of active pJIA and has extended the PsA indication for this same patient population. ""This latest FDA approval of SIMPONI ARIA for pediatric use inactivepJIA and active PsA not only brings a new option to young patients living with these diseases but also adds to the growing body of evidence for this treatment,"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. ""For more than 20 years, we at Janssen have been committed to researching anti-TNF biologic agents for immune-mediated diseases and are encouraged to expand treatment options for these patients."" AboutpJIA and PsA JIA is a group of disorders characterized by arthritis persisting for at least six weeks before the age of 16 years.i Approximately 300,000 children suffer from some form of JIA in the United States.ii The polyarticular form of JIA is most common and is characterized by inflammation in more than four joints and resembles adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA).iii PsA in pediatric patients is one of the rarest subtypes of JIA and is characterized by both joint inflammation and skin lesions associated with psoriasis resembling adult PsA.iv,v Given the heterogeneity of these diseases, additional treatment options are needed for these conditions. ""For far too long, children with pJIA or PsA have had limited treatment options,"" said Seth D. Ginsberg, Co-Founder and President of the Global Healthy Living Foundation and CreakyJoints. ""This approval represents an important step forward for these children and their families."" Data Supporting Approval The approval was based on results from the GO-VIVA Phase 3 clinical trial, an open-label study in children with JIA with active polyarthritis ages 2 to 17 years who had active arthritis in five or more joints, despite receiving treatment with methotrexate for at least two months. Trial results demonstrated that pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure of SIMPONI ARIA was consistent with that of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of SIMPONI ARIA in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA and active PsA. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in adult patients with RA. The adverse reactions observed in GO-VIVA were consistent with the established safety profile of SIMPONI ARIA in adult patients with RA and PsA. ""Due to the limited availability of pediatric patients for inclusion in clinical trials, it can be challenging to build clinical studies for this young patient population,"" said Daniel J. Lovell, the Joseph E. Levinson Professor of Pediatric Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital Medical Center. ""Given these challenges, I am pleased to see Janssen advance the approval of a new treatment option for pediatric patients with pJIA and PsA an important milestone in the treatment of these complex, heterogeneous diseases."" Access to SIMPONI ARIA Janssen strives to work closely with payers, providers and pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to help ensure SIMPONI ARIA is broadly accessible to appropriate patients. JanssenCarePathoffers a comprehensive support program that helps patients get started on SIMPONI ARIA and stay on track. Janssen CarePath provides information on insurance coverage, potential out-of-pocket costs and treatment support, and identifies options that may help make treatment more affordable, including the Janssen CarePath Savings Program for commercially insured patients who are eligible. About the GO-VIVA Clinical Trial GO-VIVA is a Phase 3, open-label, single arm, multicenter study conducted across nine countries with treatment received by 127 patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, despite current treatment with methotrexate. GO-VIVA was conducted as a post-marketing requirement under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) following the initial approval of SIMPONI ARIA for adults with moderately to severely active RA in 2013. GO-VIVA was designed to evaluate the dosing of SIMPONI ARIA in children that is required to achieve drug levels and exposures that are similar to those that were shown to be safe and effective in adults with moderately to severely active RA, since active pJIA, active PsA in pediatric patients, and adult RA show similarities in disease. About SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) In addition to the treatment of children ages 2 years and olderwith active pJIA or active PsA, SIMPONI ARIA is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA, active PsA and active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). SIMPONI ARIA is currently approved for one or more of these indications in 24 countries. SIMPONI ARIA is a fully human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody that targets both soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-alpha, a protein that when overproduced in the body due to chronic inflammatory diseases can cause inflammation. For adults withRA, PsA, and AS,the SIMPONI ARIA weight-based dosage regimen is 2 mg/kg given as an IV infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. SIMPONI ARIA is given with methotrexate for the treatment of RA. For pediatric patients with pJIA and PsA, the SIMPONI ARIA body surface area (BSA)-based dosage regimen is 80 mg/m2 given as an IV infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, andevery 8 weeks thereafter. More information about SIMPONI ARIA is available at www.SimponiARIA.com. Janssen Biotech, Inc. discovered and developed SIMPONI ARIA. What is SIMPONI ARIA(golimumab)? SIMPONI ARIA is a prescription medicine used to treat: Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults, used in combination with methotrexate Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in people 2 years of age and older Active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults Active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION SERIOUS INFECTIONS SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) is a prescription medicine. SIMPONI ARIA can lower your ability to fight infections. There are reports of serious infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that have spread throughout the body, including tuberculosis (TB) and histoplasmosis. Some of these infections have been fatal. Your doctor will test you for TB before starting SIMPONI ARIA and will closely monitor you for signs of TB during treatment. Tell your doctor if you have been in close contact with people with TB.

The approval is based on results of a prospective, multi-center study (PRECEPT) which met primary safety and effectiveness endpoints and demonstrated 80 percent of persistent AF patients experienced clinical success at 15 months after ablation therapy using the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter with the CARTO VISITAG Module.1,2In addition, patients experienced clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life and the study showed significant reduction in healthcare resource utilization post-ablation.1,2 (PRNewsfoto/Biosense Webster, Inc.) (PRNewsfoto/Biosense Webster, Inc.) Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant public health issue affecting the health of millions of people and placing a critical burden on healthcare systems. Persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that lasts for more than seven days and up to one year. The management of persistent AF aims to prevent AF recurrence and associated disabilities while reducing side effects from treatment. ""Every patient and every arrhythmia are unique,"" said Dr. Francis Marchlinski***, Director of Electrophysiology, University of Pennsylvania Health System. ""This approval and the PRECEPT data provide evidence to support a tailored approach using the CARTO 3 System and THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter to treat persistent AF patients, who are more at risk for stroke and other complications from their AF."" The PRECEPT study is the first prospective, multi-center investigational device exemption study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation in patients with persistent AF, and was conducted using the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter. Results of the PRECEPT study demonstrated 80 percent of persistent AF patients experienced clinical success at 15 months after ablation therapy and 86 percent experienced freedom from repeat procedures at 15 months.3 The CARTO 3 System and THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter allow for a patient-tailored ablation approach, resulting in high long-term effectiveness in a more advanced persistent AF patient group (continuous AF > 7 days < 1 year).*2 Radiofrequency ablation with the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter led to a clinically meaningful improvement in Quality of Life (QOL), as well as a reduction in antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) use, cardioversion and hospitalization in persistent AF patients.3""Persistent AF patients face a higher risk of complications such as stroke, heart failure, and death,"" said Uri Yaron, Worldwide President of Biosense Webster, Inc. ""This approval and data from the PRECEPT study help to further our commitment toadvancing AF treatment, providing electrophysiologists with state-of-the-art options for their patients.""The PRECEPT study enrolled a total of 381 patients with documented symptomatic persistent AF who did not respond or were intolerant of one or more AADs (Class I or III). The study was conducted at 27 sites across the United States and Canada.1 The primary effectiveness endpoint was freedom from documented recurrence of atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia episodes of 30 seconds or longer and freedom from additional five failure modes: acute procedural failure, use of a non-study catheter, repeat procedures, use of new/higher dose antiarrhythmic drugs, surgical AF ablation.1 A tailored ablation strategy was used, allowing for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and additional left atrial ablations (PVI+) at the operator\'s discretion based on the patient\'s disease state.1 The study resulted in a 4.7 percent primary adverse event (PAE) rate which is comparable to PAE rates reported in paroxysmal AF studies using CF-sensing RF catheters.4,5,6About Atrial FibrillationAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) and affects nearly one percent of the population.7 During AF, the upper chambers of the heart, the atria, beat rapidly or in an uncontrolled manner, which can feel like a flutter. When the heart beats erratically, it does not pump blood as efficiently as it should. When oxygen is not being properly delivered to all parts of the body, the patient may feel ill or experience other AF symptoms. AF may not be life-threatening; however, it is important to seek treatment to control the symptoms, as AF can lead to stroke.As with any medical treatment, individual results may vary. Only a cardiologist or electrophysiologist can determine whether ablation is an appropriate course of treatment. There are potential risks including bleeding, swelling or bruising at the catheter insertion site, and infection. More serious complications are rare, which can include damage to the heart or blood vessels; blood clots (which may lead to stroke); heart attack; or death. These risks need to be discussed with your doctor and recovery takes time. The success of this procedure depends on many factors, including your physical condition and your body\'s ability to tolerate the procedure. Use care in the selection of your doctors and hospital, based on their skill and experience.About Biosense Webster, Inc.

The approval is based on results of a prospective, multi-center study (PRECEPT) which met primary safety and effectiveness endpoints and demonstrated 80 percent of persistent AF patients experienced clinical success at 15 months after ablation therapy using the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter with the CARTO VISITAG Module.1,2In addition, patients experienced clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life and the study showed significant reduction in healthcare resource utilization post-ablation.1,2 (PRNewsfoto/Biosense Webster, Inc.) (PRNewsfoto/Biosense Webster, Inc.) Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant public health issue affecting the health of millions of people and placing a critical burden on healthcare systems. Persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that lasts for more than seven days and up to one year. The management of persistent AF aims to prevent AF recurrence and associated disabilities while reducing side effects from treatment. ""Every patient and every arrhythmia are unique,"" said Dr. Francis Marchlinski***, Director of Electrophysiology, University of Pennsylvania Health System. ""This approval and the PRECEPT data provide evidence to support a tailored approach using the CARTO 3 System and THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter to treat persistent AF patients, who are more at risk for stroke and other complications from their AF."" The PRECEPT study is the first prospective, multi-center investigational device exemption study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation in patients with persistent AF, and was conducted using the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter. Results of the PRECEPT study demonstrated 80 percent of persistent AF patients experienced clinical success at 15 months after ablation therapy and 86 percent experienced freedom from repeat procedures at 15 months.3 The CARTO 3 System and THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter allow for a patient-tailored ablation approach, resulting in high long-term effectiveness in a more advanced persistent AF patient group (continuous AF > 7 days < 1 year).*2 Radiofrequency ablation with the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter led to a clinically meaningful improvement in Quality of Life (QOL), as well as a reduction in antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) use, cardioversion and hospitalization in persistent AF patients.3""Persistent AF patients face a higher risk of complications such as stroke, heart failure, and death,"" said Uri Yaron, Worldwide President of Biosense Webster, Inc. ""This approval and data from the PRECEPT study help to further our commitment toadvancing AF treatment, providing electrophysiologists with state-of-the-art options for their patients.""The PRECEPT study enrolled a total of 381 patients with documented symptomatic persistent AF who did not respond or were intolerant of one or more AADs (Class I or III). The study was conducted at 27 sites across the United States and Canada.1 The primary effectiveness endpoint was freedom from documented recurrence of atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia episodes of 30 seconds or longer and freedom from additional five failure modes: acute procedural failure, use of a non-study catheter, repeat procedures, use of new/higher dose antiarrhythmic drugs, surgical AF ablation.1 A tailored ablation strategy was used, allowing for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and additional left atrial ablations (PVI+) at the operator\'s discretion based on the patient\'s disease state.1 The study resulted in a 4.7 percent primary adverse event (PAE) rate which is comparable to PAE rates reported in paroxysmal AF studies using CF-sensing RF catheters.4,5,6About Atrial FibrillationAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) and affects nearly one percent of the population.7 During AF, the upper chambers of the heart, the atria, beat rapidly or in an uncontrolled manner, which can feel like a flutter. When the heart beats erratically, it does not pump blood as efficiently as it should. When oxygen is not being properly delivered to all parts of the body, the patient may feel ill or experience other AF symptoms. AF may not be life-threatening; however, it is important to seek treatment to control the symptoms, as AF can lead to stroke.As with any medical treatment, individual results may vary. Only a cardiologist or electrophysiologist can determine whether ablation is an appropriate course of treatment. There are potential risks including bleeding, swelling or bruising at the catheter insertion site, and infection. More serious complications are rare, which can include damage to the heart or blood vessels; blood clots (which may lead to stroke); heart attack; or death. These risks need to be discussed with your doctor and recovery takes time. The success of this procedure depends on many factors, including your physical condition and your body\'s ability to tolerate the procedure. Use care in the selection of your doctors and hospital, based on their skill and experience.About Biosense Webster, Inc.

This Market Spotlight report covers the Zika virus market, comprising key pipeline therapies, clinical trials, probability of success, epidemiology, and licensing and acquisition deals. Key Takeaways The Zika virus was first reported in continental South America in Brazil in May 2015. In February 2016, between 440,000 and 1,300,000 people were infected in Brazil. In the US, about 225 Zika virus cases were reported in August 2017. In addition, 554 cases were reported in people infected through local mosquito-borne transmission. Furthermore, autochthonous Zika virus transmission was reported in 25 countries in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. In 2016, it was estimated that there were between 508 and 1,778 imported cases in Europe, particularly in France, Portugal, and Italy. The majority of industry-sponsored drugs in active clinical development for Zika virus are in Phase I, with just a single product in Phase II. Therapies in development for Zika virus focus on the immune system, viral antigens, and RNA polymerase. Candidates comprise DNA vaccines such as the National Institutes of Health\'s Zika Virus Vaccine, GeneOne\'s GLS-5700, and Inovio\'s INO-A002; Moderna\'s mRNA vaccine; Themis Bioscience\'s recombinant viral vector vaccine; Imutex\'s AGS-v vaccine; hVIVO\'s AGS-v PLUS vaccine; Johnson & Johnson\'s Ad26.ZIKV.001 vaccine; Takeda\'s TAK-426 vaccine; Emergent BioSolutions\' ZIKV-IG; Valneva\'s VLA 1601; and BioCryst\'s galidesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. The overall likelihood of approval of a Phase I antiviral asset is 14.3%, and the average probability a drug advances from Phase III is 71.3%. Drugs, on average, take 8.7 years from Phase I to approval, compared to 9.1 years in the overall infectious disease space. All clinical trials for Zika virus have been in either Phase I or Phase II, with no Phase III trials to date. The US leads in terms of the number of Zika virus clinical trials globally.

Media Contact: Rachel Darwin267-622-6624[emailprotected] SOURCE National Comprehensive Cancer Network Related Links www.nccn.org', 'RARITAN, N.J., Oct. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announcedtoday it has submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a new indication to expand the use of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). If approved, this new indication for the XARELTO vascular dose (2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin 75-100 mg once daily) would include reducing the risk of major thrombotic vascular events such as heart attack, stroke and amputation in patients after recent lower-extremity revascularization, a common procedure in which blood flow is restored to the legs and feet due to symptomatic PAD. The application is based on data from the VOYAGER PAD study, which showed XARELTO (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily) was superior to aspirin alone in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular (CV) and limb events, with similar rates of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding.

""Various antithrombotic regimens have been evaluated for short- and long-term prevention of major vascular events in patients with PAD, but only rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin has demonstrated a significant benefit over aspirin alone,"" said James List, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""Data from the VOYAGER PAD trial were the first in 20 years to show clinical benefit with an antithrombotic therapy in the symptomatic PAD population after lower-extremity revascularization, which speaks to the need for a new treatment in this space. We look forward to discussing these data with the FDA."" Janssen and its development partner Bayer have conducted two major Phase 3 trials, VOYAGER PAD and COMPASS, that evaluated the use of dual antithrombotic pathway inhibition with XARELTO plus aspirin in patients with PAD. XARELTO, in combination with aspirin, was approved by the FDA in 2018 to reduce the risk of major CV events in patients with chronic PAD and coronary artery disease (CAD) the only direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) approved for use in these populations. PAD is a serious underlying health crisis that impacts an estimated 20 million Americans, with only 8.5 million diagnosed.i,ii PAD also increases the risk for major CV events and is the leading cause of amputation,iii which can double a patient\'s risk of death.iv About VOYAGER PADThe Phase 3 VOYAGER PAD study included 6,564 patients from 542 sites across 34 countries worldwide. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and received either XARELTO(2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily) (n=3,286) or aspirin alone (100 mg once daily) (n=3,278). Patients were stratified by revascularization procedure type (endovascular vs. surgical) and use of clopidogrel, which was limited and administered based on the treating physician\'s discretion. Patients were followed for a median duration of 28 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of major adverse limb and CV events, including acute limb ischemia, major amputation for vascular causes, heart attack (myocardial infarction), ischemic stroke, or death from CV causes. The principal safety endpoint was major bleeding according to the TIMI classification. Eligible patients were at least 50 years old and had documented symptomatic lower-extremity PAD. Patients were eligible after a successful revascularization for symptomatic PAD within the last 10 days. Approximately two-thirds were treated with an endovascular procedure (65%) and one-third treated surgically (35%). Patients were excluded if they were clinically unstable, at heightened bleeding risk, or needed prohibited concomitant medications, including long-term clopidogrel. The median age was 67 years and 26% were women. Common risk factors for PAD included diabetes, an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (indicating mild-to-moderate kidney disease) and current smokers. WHAT IS XARELTO(rivaroxaban)? XARELTOis a prescription medicine used to: reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people who have a medical condition called atrial fibrillation that is not caused by a heart valve problem. With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE) reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months help prevent a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had hip or knee replacement surgery help prevent blood clots in certain people hospitalized for an acute illness and after discharge, who are at risk of getting blood clots because of the loss of or decreased ability to move around (mobility) and other risks for getting blood clots, and who do not have a high risk of bleeding XARELTO is used with low dose aspirin to: reduce the risk of serious heart problems, heart attack and stroke in people with coronary artery disease (a condition where the blood supply to the heart is reduced or blocked) or peripheral artery disease (a condition where the blood flow to the legs is reduced) It is not known if XARELTOis safe and effective in children. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT XARELTO? XARELTO may cause serious side effects, including: Increased risk of blood clots if you stop taking XARELTO. People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) that is not caused by a heart valve problem (nonvalvular) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.Do not stop taking XARELTOwithout talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTOincreases your risk of having a stroke.If you have to stop taking XARELTO, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming. Increased risk of bleeding. XARELTO can cause bleeding which can be serious, and may lead to death. This is because XARELTO is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that lowers blood clotting. During treatment with XARELTO you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. You may be at higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO and have certain other medical problems.You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including: Aspirin or aspirin-containing products Long-term (chronic) use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Jantoven) Any medicine that contains heparin Clopidogrel (Plavix) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above. Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding: Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as: Nosebleeds that happen often Unusual bleeding from gums Menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding Bleeding that is severe or you cannot control Red, pink, or brown urine Bright red or black stools (looks like tar) Cough up blood or blood clots Vomit blood or your vomit looks like ""coffee grounds"" Headaches, feeling dizzy or weak Pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma). People who take a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) like XARELTO, and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if: A thin tube called an epidural catheter is placed in your back to give you certain medicine You take NSAIDs or a medicine to prevent blood from clotting You have a history of difficult or repeated epidural or spinal punctures You have a history of problems with your spine or have had surgery on your spine If you take XARELTO and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots. Tell your doctor right away if you have back pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), or loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence). XARELTO is not for use in people with artificial heart valves. XARELTO is not for use in people with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially with positive triple antibody testing. Do not take XARELTO if you: Currently have certain types of abnormal bleeding. Talk to your doctor before taking XARELTO if you currently have unusual bleeding. Are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the ingredients of XARELTO. Before taking XARELTO, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: Have ever had bleeding problems Have liver or kidney problems Have antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

The allowance is based on US Patent Application 15/987,933 entitled: Formulations for Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The inventor, Prof. Daniel Javitt, M.D., Ph.D., is co-founder of NeuroRx and was among the first to report the role of the NMDA receptor in psychiatric disease. The treatment consists of the administration of ketamine, a potent NMDA receptor antagonist, to a subject in need followed by the administration of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising of different dosages of D-cycloserine and an anti-depression or anti-psychosis agent. ""In line with our mission to focus on areas of very high unmet need, we are very pleased to further extend our drug platform to another such area in psychiatry for which there are only very limited treatment options. PTSD does not just happen to combat veterans, it can occur in all people of any ethnicity or age and it often develops along with other related conditions such as depression, substance abuse, thoughts of suicide, memory problems and other physical and mental health problems resulting in a significant economic burden for both patients and the healthcare system,"" said Dr. Jonathan Javitt, CEO and Chairman of NeuroRx. An estimated 70% of adults in the United States have experienced a traumatic event at least once in their lives and up to 20% of these people go on to develop PTSD, which can affect all aspects of a person\'s life including mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Currently, the primary treatment is psychotherapy. Psychotherapy can also be used in combination with medication to help reduce symptoms. The company will explore development options for this area, including PTSD associated with suicidality. About NeuroRx, Inc.

SOURCE ExeVir Bio', 'BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced the submission of a Type II variation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval to expand the use of the DARZALEX (daratumumab) subcutaneous (SC) formulation to include the treatment of patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis is a rare and potentially fatal disease that occurs when an insoluble protein called amyloid builds up in tissues and organs, interfering with healthy tissue and organ function.3,4 There are currently no therapeutic options approved by regulatory bodies such as the EMA or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of the disease.1,2 The submission is based on data from the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study, presented during the 2020 European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab SC in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (D-VCd) compared with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCd) alone in the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis. The study data showed a significantly higher haematologic complete response rate for patients with the addition of daratumumab compared with patients treated with VCd alone.5 Overall, the safety profile of D-VCd demonstrated a consistent safety profile compared to the VCd regimen and the known safety profile of daratumumab.5 The current management of AL amyloidosis focuses on slowing production of amyloid protein and controlling symptoms; however, there are no EMA-approved therapies for this difficult-to-treat, rare disease, said Dr Catherine Taylor, VP, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd. Middle East. If approved, adding daratumumab to this combination could address a significant unmet need and offer new hope to patients with AL amyloidosis, who have poor prognoses and have long been waiting for therapeutic options. Daratumumab is an important foundational therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma and now, on the basis of the ANDROMEDA study results, has shown that it can improve outcomes in a related plasma cell disorder, AL amyloidosis, said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. We are excited about the potential for daratumumab, as part of a regimen for newly diagnosed patients with AL amyloidosis to alter the poor prognosis of their disease and reduce organ damage, which is an unfortunate life-threatening complication of this serious disease. In September 2020, Janssen submitted a supplemental Biologics Licence Application (sBLA) to the U.S. FDA seeking approval of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab for the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis.6 #ENDS# About the ANDROMEDA Study5,7 ANDROMEDA (NCT03201965) is an ongoing Phase 3, randomised, open-label study investigating the safety and efficacy of daratumumab SC in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd), compared to VCd alone, in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis.5,7 The study includes 388 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with measurable haematologic disease and one or more organs affected. The primary endpoint is overall complete haematologic response rate by intent-to-treat (ITT). Secondary endpoints include major organ deterioration, progression-free survival, major organ deterioration event free survival, organ response rate, overall survival, and time to haematologic response, among others.5,7 About AL Amyloidosis Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare and potentially fatal haematologic disorder that can affect the function of multiple organs.1,2 The disease occurs when bone marrow produces abnormal antibodies called light chains, which clump together to form a substance called amyloid. These clumps of amyloid are deposited in tissues and vital organs and interfere with normal organ function, eventually causing organ deterioration.1,2 AL amyloidosis is the most common type of amyloidosis. It frequently affects the heart, kidneys, digestive tract, liver and nervous system.1,2 Diagnosis is often delayed and prognosis is poor due to advanced, multi-organ, particularly cardiac, involvement. Approximately 30,000 to 45,000 patients in the European Union and the United States have AL amyloidosis.8 About daratumumab and daratumumab SC Daratumumab is a first-in-class biologic targeting CD38, a surface protein that is highly expressed across multiple myeloma (MM) cells, regardless of disease stage.9,10 Daratumumab is believed to induce tumour cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), as well as through apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death.10 A subset of myeloid derived suppressor cells (CD38+ MDSCs), CD38+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD38+ B cells (Bregs) are decreased by daratumumab-mediated cell lysis.10 In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive licence to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab.11 Since launch, it is estimated that more than 154,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.12 In June 2020, daratumumab SC (daratumumab and hyaluronidase human-fihj) was approved by the European Commission as the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with multiple myeloma.13 Daratumumab SC is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\'s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.13 Daratumumab is being evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development programme across a range of treatment settings in MM, such as in frontline and relapsed settings.14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess the potential of daratumumab SC in other malignant and pre-malignant haematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as smouldering myeloma and AL amyloidosis.22,23 For more information, please see https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, progressive, immune-mediated disease characterized by joint inflammation, enthesitis (inflammation where the bone, tendon and ligament meet), dactylitis (severe inflammation of the digits of the hands and feet), axial disease (pain in the axial skeleton, primarily in the spine, hips and shoulders) and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.3 The disease commonly appears between the ages of 30 and 50 but can develop at any time.4 Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset of the disease.4 Without early recognition, diagnosis and treatment, the disease can continue to progress.4 About Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition that is often characterized by symptoms that include pain, stiffness and inflammation of the joints, which can lead to joint destruction and disability.5 An estimated 1.5 million Americans have the condition, which affects nearly three times as many women as men.6 While the cause of RA is unknown, many cases are believed to result from genetic and environmental factors.5 There is no medical cure for RA, but there are numerous medications available to help alleviate symptoms and prevent joint destruction. About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Lupus is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease that can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.7 SLE can range from mild to severe and is characterized by inflammation of any organ system and complex auto-antibody production (antibodies directed against normal human tissue).8 The disease most often affects women and disproportionately affects women of African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American descent compared to Caucasian women.9 Incidence rates in the United States are estimated at 5.6 cases per 100,000. Lupus is estimated to affect at least 5 million people worldwide.10 About the DISCOVER Development Program DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 are Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of TREMFYA in 1,120 adult patients with active PsA who had inadequate response to standard therapies. In DISCOVER-1, approximately 31 percent of patients had been previously treated with up to two anti-TNF-alpha agents whereas in DISCOVER-2 all patients were nave to biologic therapy. Approximately 58 percent of patients from both studies had concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use. The DISCOVER-1 study showed that in patients who received TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks after two starter doses, 52 percent achieved an ACR20 response versus 22 percent treated with placebo (p <0.0001), with a comparable response irrespective of prior TNF exposure. In DISCOVER-2, 64 percent of patients who received TREMFYA every 8 weeks achieved an ACR20 response, versus 33 percent treated with placebo (p <0.0001). TREMFYA was also shown to relieve patients\' pain in their soft tissue and inflammation in their fingers and toes. In a pre-specified pooled analysis of DISCOVER-1 and -2 at week 24, treatment with TREMFYA every 8 weeks resolved enthesitis in 50 percent of patients, versus 29 percent in patients receiving placebo (p=0.0301). In another pre-specified pooled analysis at week 24, treatment with TREMFYA every 8 weeks also resolved dactylitis in 59 percent of patients, versus 42 percent receiving placebo (p=0.0301). Beyond its impact on improving symptoms of PsA in joints, among patients with psoriatic skin involvement, TREMFYA also resulted in an improvement in the skin manifestations of psoriasis in patients with PsA. About TREMFYA (guselkumab) Developed by Janssen, TREMFYA is the first approved human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. TREMFYA is approved in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light). It is approved as a prescription medicine in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Brazil for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA, and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending its expanded use for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA in the European Union (EU).11 A final decision from the European Commission (EC) regarding PsA indication expansion is expected later this year. IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and PsA.12 The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA.

DARZALEX FASPROTMis the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with multiple myeloma globally.1DARZALEX FASPROTM is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\'s ENHANZE drug delivery technology. In August 2012, Janssen entered into an exclusive global license and development agreement with Genmab A/S to develop, manufacture, and commercialize DARZALEX.2DARZALEX has been approved in eight indications, three of which are in the frontline setting, including for newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible as well as those who are ineligible.3,4,5,6,7,8 For more information, visit www.DARZALEX.com. About TalquetamabTalquetamab is a first-in-class investigational bispecific antibody targeting both GPRC5D, a novel multiple myeloma target, and CD3, the T-cell receptor.9CD3 is involved in activating T-cells and GPRC5D is highly expressed in multiple myeloma cells.10,11Results from preclinical studies in mouse models demonstrate that talquetamab induces the T-cell-mediated killing of GPRC5D-expressing multiple myeloma cells through the recruitment and activation of CD3-positive T-cells and inhibits tumor formation and growth.10 Talquetamab is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and is also being explored in combination studies. The development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.\'s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBodytechnology platform.* About Teclistamab Teclistamab is an investigational bispecific antibody targeting both BCMA and CD3. BCMA, B-cell maturation antigen, is expressed at significantly higher levels on multiple myeloma cells.12,13,14,15,16Teclistamab redirects CD3-positive T-cells to BCMA-expressing myeloma cells to induce cytotoxicity of the targeted cells.14,15Results from preclinical studies demonstrate that teclistamab kills myeloma cell lines and bone marrow-derived myeloma cells from heavily pretreated patients.15 Teclistamab is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and is also being explored in combination studies. The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.\'s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBodytechnology platform.* In October 2020, the European Commission granted Janssen an orphan designation for teclistamab. AboutIMBRUVICAIMBRUVICA is the first-in-class Bruton\'s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that is orally administered only once-daily. IMBRUVICA is jointly developed and commercialized by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.IMBRUVICA is indicated for adults in five disease areas (CLL, small lymphocytic leukemia, MCL, WM, marginal zone lymphoma) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD).17 For more information, visit www.IMBRUVICA.com. About JNJ-3093In 2018, Janssen enteredinto a worldwide collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb on a program to develop and commercialize JNJ-3093 (BMS-986177), an oral small molecule Factor XIa Inhibitor, for the prevention and treatment of major thrombotic conditions. About NipocalimabNipocalimab is a high affinity, fully human, aglycosylated, effectorless anti-FcRn IgG1 monoclonal antibody being studied for autoantibody-driven conditions including myasthenia gravis, hemolytic diseases of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.18Nipocalimab targets FcRn, which plays a central role in prolonging the halflife of IgG autoantibodies.19Antagonism of this receptor reduces overall IgG autoantibody levels without widespread immune suppression. In 2019, nipocalimab receivedRare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for nipocalimab in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and Fast Track Designation for wAIHA.20 In 2020, Johnson & Johnson acquiredMomenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., including full global rights to nipocalimab. DARZALEXFASPROIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONSDARZALEXFASPROis contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to daratumumab, hyaluronidase or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSHypersensitivity and Other Administration ReactionsBoth systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and local injection-site reactions can occur with DARZALEXFASPRO. Systemic ReactionsIn a pooled safety population of 490patients who received DARZALEXFASPROas monotherapy or in combination, 11% of patients experienced a systemic administration-related reaction (Grade 2: 3.9%, Grade 3: 1.4%). Systemic administration-related reactions occurred in 10% of patients with the first injection, 0.2% with the second injection, and cumulatively 0.8% with subsequent injections. The median time to onset was 3.7hours (range: 9minutes to 3.5days). Of the 84systemic administration-related reactions that occurred in 52patients, 73(87%) occurred on the day of DARZALEXFASPROadministration. Delayed systemic administration-related reactions have occurred in less than 1% of the patients. Severe reactions included hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension and tachycardia. Other signs and symptoms of systemic administration-related reactions may include respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing, as well as anaphylactic reaction, pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, nausea, and hypotension. Pre-medicate patients with histamine-1 receptor antagonist, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Monitor patients for systemic administration-related reactions, especially following the first and second injections. For anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) administration-related reactions, immediately and permanently discontinue DARZALEXFASPRO.Consider administering corticosteroids and other medications after the administration of DARZALEXFASPROdepending on dosing regimen and medical history to minimize the risk of delayed (defined as occurring the day after administration) systemic administration-related reactions. Local ReactionsIn this pooled safety population, injection-site reactions occurred in 8% of patients, including Grade2 reactions in 0.6%. The most frequent (>1%) injection-site reaction was injection site erythema. These local reactions occurred a median of 7minutes (range: 0minutes to 4.7days) after starting administration of DARZALEXFASPRO. Monitor for local reactions and consider symptomatic management. NeutropeniaDaratumumab may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy.Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEXFASPROuntil recovery of neutrophils. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEXFASPRO, higher rates of Grade 3-4 neutropenia were observed. ThrombocytopeniaDaratumumab may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy.Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEXFASPROuntil recovery of platelets. Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on the mechanism of action, DARZALEXFASPROcan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEXFASPROmay cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEXFASPROand for 3months after the last dose. The combination of DARZALEXFASPROwith lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy. Interference with Serological TestingDaratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab administration. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEXFASPRO.Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEXFASPRO. Interference with Determination of Complete ResponseDaratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some DARZALEXFASPRO-treated patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reaction (20%) with DARZALEXFASPRO monotherapy is: upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse reactions with combination therapy (20% for any combination) include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, pyrexia, cough, muscle spasms, back pain, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral sensory neuropathy, constipation, and pneumonia. The most common hematology laboratory abnormalities (40%) with DARZALEXFASPROare decreased leukocytes, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased platelets, and decreased hemoglobin. Please see full Prescribing Information atwww.DARZALEX.com. DARZALEXIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS DARZALEX is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-Related Reactions DARZALEX can cause severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination: N=2066), infusion-related reactions occurred in 37% of patients with the Week1 (16mg/kg) infusion, 2% with the Week2 infusion, and cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade3/4 infusion-related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was 1.5hours (range: 0 to 73hours). Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4hours of completing DARZALEX. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema, and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting, and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension. When DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (CASSIOPEIA) for a median of 3.75months (range: 2.4 to 6.9months), upon re-initiation of DARZALEX, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was 11% for the first infusion following ASCT. Infusion-related reactions occurring at re-initiation of DARZALEX following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3 or 4: <1%) with those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. In EQUULEUS, patients receiving combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first 16mg/kg dose at Week 1 split over two days, ie, 8mg/kg on Day1 and Day2, respectively. The incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing infusion-related reactions on Day1 of Week1, 4% on Day2 of Week1, and 8% with subsequent infusions. Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion. To reduce the risk of delayed infusion-related reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interference With Serological Testing Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type is not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX. Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia DARZALEX may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of neutrophils or for recovery of platelets. Interference With Determination of Complete Response Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.

IMBRUVICA IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage: Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients who received IMBRUVICA. Majorhemorrhage ( Grade 3, serious, or any central nervous system events; e.g., intracranial hemorrhage [including subdural hematoma], gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post procedural hemorrhage) occurred in 4% of patients, with fatalities occurring in 0.4% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA in 27 clinical trials. Bleeding events, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in 39% of patients who received IMBRUVICA. The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. Use of either anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents concomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major hemorrhage. Across clinical trials, 3.1% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy experienced major hemorrhage. The addition of antiplatelet therapy with or without anticoagulant therapy increased this percentage to 4.4%, and the addition of anticoagulant therapy with or without antiplatelet therapy increased this percentage to 6.1%. Consider the risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding. Infections: Fatal and non-fatal infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 21% of 1,476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately. Cytopenias: In 645 patients with B-cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA as a single agent, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% and Grade 3 or 4 anemia in 3%, based on laboratory measurements. Monitor complete blood counts monthly. Cardiac Arrhythmias: Fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias have occurred with IMBRUVICA. Grade 3 or greater ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 0.2% of patients and Grade 3 or greater atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter occurred in 4% of 1,476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials. These events have occurred particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous history of cardiac arrhythmias. Periodically monitor patients clinically for cardiac arrhythmias. Obtain an ECG for patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, chest pain) or new onset dyspnea. Manage cardiac arrhythmias appropriately, and if it persists, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and follow dose modification guidelines. Hypertension: Hypertension occurred in 19% of 1,476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials. Grade 3 or greater hypertension occurred in 8% of patients. Based on data from 1,124 of these patients, the median time to onset was 5.9 months (range, 0.03 to 24 months). Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA and initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive medication throughout treatment with IMBRUVICA as appropriate. Second Primary Malignancies: Other malignancies (10%), including non-skin carcinomas (4%), occurred among the 1,476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (6%). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with IMBRUVICA. Assess the baseline risk (e.g., high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions. Monitor patients closely and treat as appropriate. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMBRUVICA and for 1 month after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during the same time period. ADVERSE REACTIONS B-cell malignancies: The most common adverse reactions (30%) in patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL/SLL, WM and MZL) were thrombocytopenia (54.5%)*, diarrhea (43.8%), fatigue (39.1%), musculoskeletal pain (38.8%), neutropenia (38.6%)*, rash (35.8%), anemia (35.0%)*, and bruising (32.0%). The most common Grade 3 adverse reactions (5%) in patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL/SLL, WM and MZL) were neutropenia (20.7%)*, thrombocytopenia (13.6%)*, pneumonia (8.2%), and hypertension (8.0%). Approximately 9% (CLL/SLL), 14% (MCL), 14% (WM) and 10% (MZL) of patients had a dose reduction due to adverse reactions. Approximately 4-10% (CLL/SLL), 9% (MCL), and 7% (WM [5%] and MZL [13%]) of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. cGVHD: The most common adverse reactions (20%) in patients with cGVHD were fatigue (57%), bruising (40%), diarrhea (36%), thrombocytopenia (33%)*, muscle spasms (29%), stomatitis (29%), nausea (26%), hemorrhage (26%), anemia (24%)*, and pneumonia (21%). The most common Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (5%) reported in patients with cGVHD were pneumonia (14%), fatigue (12%), diarrhea (10%), neutropenia (10%)*, sepsis (10%), hypokalemia (7%), headache (5%), musculoskeletal pain (5%), and pyrexia (5%). Twenty-four percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA in the cGVHD trial discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 26% of patients. *Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) were based on laboratory measurements. DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of IMBRUVICA with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations. Dose modifications of IMBRUVICA may be recommended when used concomitantly with posaconazole, voriconazole, and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid concomitant use of other strong CYP3A inhibitors. Interrupt IMBRUVICA if strong inhibitors are used short-term (e.g., for 7 days). See dose modification guidelines in USPI sections 2.3 and 7.1. CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers. SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic Impairment (based on Child-Pugh criteria): Avoid use of IMBRUVICA in patients with severe baseline hepatic impairment. In patients with mild or moderate impairment, reduce recommended IMBRUVICA dose and monitor more frequently for adverse reactions of IMBRUVICA. Please click here for full Prescribing Information.

The allowance is based on US Patent Application 15/987,933 entitled: Formulations for Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The inventor, Prof. Daniel Javitt, M.D., Ph.D., is co-founder of NeuroRx and was among the first to report the role of the NMDA receptor in psychiatric disease. The treatment consists of the administration of ketamine, a potent NMDA receptor antagonist, to a subject in need followed by the administration of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising of different dosages of D-cycloserine and an anti-depression or anti-psychosis agent. ""In line with our mission to focus on areas of very high unmet need, we are very pleased to further extend our drug platform to another such area in psychiatry for which there are only very limited treatment options. PTSD does not just happen to combat veterans, it can occur in all people of any ethnicity or age and it often develops along with other related conditions such as depression, substance abuse, thoughts of suicide, memory problems and other physical and mental health problems resulting in a significant economic burden for both patients and the healthcare system,"" said Dr. Jonathan Javitt, CEO and Chairman of NeuroRx. An estimated 70% of adults in the United States have experienced a traumatic event at least once in their lives and up to 20% of these people go on to develop PTSD, which can affect all aspects of a person\'s life including mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Currently, the primary treatment is psychotherapy. Psychotherapy can also be used in combination with medication to help reduce symptoms. The company will explore development options for this area, including PTSD associated with suicidality. About NeuroRx, Inc. NeuroRx draws upon more than 100 years of collective drug development experience and is led by former senior executives of Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, PPD. In addition to its work on RLF-100, NeuroRx has been awarded Breakthrough Therapy Designation and a Special Protocol Agreement to develop NRX-101 for the treatment of Severe Bipolar Depression in Patients that are also acutely suicidal, and is currently in Phase 3 trials.

AL amyloidosis is a rare and potentially fatal disease that occurs when an insoluble protein called amyloid builds up in tissues and organs, interfering with healthy tissue and organ function.3,4 There are currently no therapeutic options approved by regulatory bodies such as the EMA or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of the disease.1,2 The submission is based on data from the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study, presented during the 2020 European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab SC in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (D-VCd) compared with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCd) alone in the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis. The study data showed a significantly higher haematologic complete response rate for patients with the addition of daratumumab compared with patients treated with VCd alone.5 Overall, the safety profile of D-VCd demonstrated a consistent safety profile compared to the VCd regimen and the known safety profile of daratumumab.5 The current management of AL amyloidosis focuses on slowing production of amyloid protein and controlling symptoms; however, there are no EMA-approved therapies for this difficult-to-treat, rare disease, said Dr Catherine Taylor, VP, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd. Middle East. If approved, adding daratumumab to this combination could address a significant unmet need and offer new hope to patients with AL amyloidosis, who have poor prognoses and have long been waiting for therapeutic options. Daratumumab is an important foundational therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma and now, on the basis of the ANDROMEDA study results, has shown that it can improve outcomes in a related plasma cell disorder, AL amyloidosis, said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. We are excited about the potential for daratumumab, as part of a regimen for newly diagnosed patients with AL amyloidosis to alter the poor prognosis of their disease and reduce organ damage, which is an unfortunate life-threatening complication of this serious disease. In September 2020, Janssen submitted a supplemental Biologics Licence Application (sBLA) to the U.S. FDA seeking approval of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab for the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis.6 #ENDS# About the ANDROMEDA Study5,7 ANDROMEDA (NCT03201965) is an ongoing Phase 3, randomised, open-label study investigating the safety and efficacy of daratumumab SC in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd), compared to VCd alone, in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis.5,7 The study includes 388 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with measurable haematologic disease and one or more organs affected. The primary endpoint is overall complete haematologic response rate by intent-to-treat (ITT). Secondary endpoints include major organ deterioration, progression-free survival, major organ deterioration event free survival, organ response rate, overall survival, and time to haematologic response, among others.5,7 About AL Amyloidosis Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare and potentially fatal haematologic disorder that can affect the function of multiple organs.1,2 The disease occurs when bone marrow produces abnormal antibodies called light chains, which clump together to form a substance called amyloid. These clumps of amyloid are deposited in tissues and vital organs and interfere with normal organ function, eventually causing organ deterioration.1,2 AL amyloidosis is the most common type of amyloidosis. It frequently affects the heart, kidneys, digestive tract, liver and nervous system.1,2 Diagnosis is often delayed and prognosis is poor due to advanced, multi-organ, particularly cardiac, involvement. Approximately 30,000 to 45,000 patients in the European Union and the United States have AL amyloidosis.8 About daratumumab and daratumumab SC Daratumumab is a first-in-class biologic targeting CD38, a surface protein that is highly expressed across multiple myeloma (MM) cells, regardless of disease stage.9,10 Daratumumab is believed to induce tumour cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), as well as through apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death.10 A subset of myeloid derived suppressor cells (CD38+ MDSCs), CD38+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD38+ B cells (Bregs) are decreased by daratumumab-mediated cell lysis.10 In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive licence to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab.11 Since launch, it is estimated that more than 154,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.12 In June 2020, daratumumab SC (daratumumab and hyaluronidase human-fihj) was approved by the European Commission as the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with multiple myeloma.13 Daratumumab SC is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\'s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.13 Daratumumab is being evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development programme across a range of treatment settings in MM, such as in frontline and relapsed settings.14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess the potential of daratumumab SC in other malignant and pre-malignant haematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as smouldering myeloma and AL amyloidosis.22,23 For more information, please see https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, progressive, immune-mediated disease characterized by joint inflammation, enthesitis (inflammation where the bone, tendon and ligament meet), dactylitis (severe inflammation of the digits of the hands and feet), axial disease (pain in the axial skeleton, primarily in the spine, hips and shoulders) and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.3 The disease commonly appears between the ages of 30 and 50 but can develop at any time.4 Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset of the disease.4 Without early recognition, diagnosis and treatment, the disease can continue to progress.4 About Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition that is often characterized by symptoms that include pain, stiffness and inflammation of the joints, which can lead to joint destruction and disability.5 An estimated 1.5 million Americans have the condition, which affects nearly three times as many women as men.6 While the cause of RA is unknown, many cases are believed to result from genetic and environmental factors.5 There is no medical cure for RA, but there are numerous medications available to help alleviate symptoms and prevent joint destruction. About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Lupus is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease that can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.7 SLE can range from mild to severe and is characterized by inflammation of any organ system and complex auto-antibody production (antibodies directed against normal human tissue).8 The disease most often affects women and disproportionately affects women of African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American descent compared to Caucasian women.9 Incidence rates in the United States are estimated at 5.6 cases per 100,000. Lupus is estimated to affect at least 5 million people worldwide.10 About the DISCOVER Development Program DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 are Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of TREMFYA in 1,120 adult patients with active PsA who had inadequate response to standard therapies. In DISCOVER-1, approximately 31 percent of patients had been previously treated with up to two anti-TNF-alpha agents whereas in DISCOVER-2 all patients were nave to biologic therapy. Approximately 58 percent of patients from both studies had concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use. The DISCOVER-1 study showed that in patients who received TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks after two starter doses, 52 percent achieved an ACR20 response versus 22 percent treated with placebo (p <0.0001), with a comparable response irrespective of prior TNF exposure. In DISCOVER-2, 64 percent of patients who received TREMFYA every 8 weeks achieved an ACR20 response, versus 33 percent treated with placebo (p <0.0001). TREMFYA was also shown to relieve patients\' pain in their soft tissue and inflammation in their fingers and toes. In a pre-specified pooled analysis of DISCOVER-1 and -2 at week 24, treatment with TREMFYA every 8 weeks resolved enthesitis in 50 percent of patients, versus 29 percent in patients receiving placebo (p=0.0301). In another pre-specified pooled analysis at week 24, treatment with TREMFYA every 8 weeks also resolved dactylitis in 59 percent of patients, versus 42 percent receiving placebo (p=0.0301). Beyond its impact on improving symptoms of PsA in joints, among patients with psoriatic skin involvement, TREMFYA also resulted in an improvement in the skin manifestations of psoriasis in patients with PsA. About TREMFYA (guselkumab) Developed by Janssen, TREMFYA is the first approved human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. TREMFYA is approved in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light). It is approved as a prescription medicine in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Brazil for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA, and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending its expanded use for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA in the European Union (EU).11 A final decision from the European Commission (EC) regarding PsA indication expansion is expected later this year. IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and PsA.12 The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA.

REMICADE (INFLIXIMAB) IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Only your doctor can recommend a course of treatment after checking your health condition. REMICADE (infliximab) can cause serious side effects such as lowering your ability to fight infections. Some patients, especially those 65 years and older, have had serious infections which include tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria that have spread throughout the body or caused infections in certain areas (such as skin). Some of these infections have been fatal. Your doctor should monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with REMICADE. Unusual cancers have been reported in children and teenage patients taking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker medicines. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare form of fatal lymphoma, has occurred mostly in male teenagers or young men with Crohn\'s disease or ulcerative colitis who were taking REMICADE and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine.For children and adults taking TNF blockers, including REMICADE, the chances of getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. You should discuss any concerns about your health and medical care with your doctor. It is not known if REMICADE is safe and effective in children under 6 years of age. What should I tell my doctor before I take REMICADE? You should let your doctor know if you have or ever had any of the following: Tuberculosis (TB) or have been near someone who has TB. Your doctor will check you for TB with a skin test. If you have latent (inactive) TB, you will begin TB treatment before you start REMICADE. Lived in a region where certain fungal infections like histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis are common. Infections that keep coming back, have diabetes or an immune system problem. Any type of cancer or a risk factor for developing cancer, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or had phototherapy for psoriasis. Heart failure or any heart condition. Many people with heart failure should not take REMICADE. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or think you may be a carrier of HBV. Your doctor will test you for HBV. Nervous system disorders (like multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barr syndrome). Also tell your doctor if you: Use the medicines Kineret (anakinra), Orencia (abatacept) or Actemra (tocilizumab) or other medicines called biologics used to treat the same problems as REMICADE. Are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, are breast-feeding, or have a baby and were using REMICADE during your pregnancy. Tell your baby\'s doctor about your REMICADE use. If your baby receives a live vaccine within 6 months after birth, your baby may develop infections with serious complications that can lead to death. Recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. Adults and children taking REMICADE should not receive live vaccines or treatment with a weakened bacteria (such as BCG for bladder cancer) while taking REMICADE. What should I watch for and talk to my doctor about before or while taking REMICADE? The following serious (sometimes fatal) side effects have been reported in people taking REMICADE. You should tell your doctor right away if you have any of the signs listed below: Serious infections (like TB, blood infections, pneumonia)fever, tiredness, cough, flu-like symptoms, or warm, red or painful skin or any open sores. REMICADE can make you more likely to get an infection or make any infection that you have worse. Reactivation of HBVfeeling unwell, poor appetite, tiredness, fever, skin rash and/or joint pain. Lymphoma, or any other cancers in adults and children. Skin cancerany changes in or growths on your skin. Cervical canceryour doctor may recommend that you be regularly screened. Some women with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those over 60, have developed cervical cancer. Heart failurenew or worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, swelling of ankles or feet, or sudden weight gain. Other heart problems within 24 hours of infusion, including heart attack, low blood flow to the heart, or abnormal heart rhythmchest discomfort or pain, arm pain, stomach pain, shortness of breath, anxiety, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, sweating, nausea, vomiting, fluttering or pounding in your chest, and/or a fast or a slow heartbeat.

In 2019, nipocalimab receivedRare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for nipocalimab in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and Fast Track Designation for wAIHA.20 In 2020, Johnson & Johnson acquiredMomenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., including full global rights to nipocalimab. DARZALEXFASPROIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONSDARZALEXFASPROis contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to daratumumab, hyaluronidase or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSHypersensitivity and Other Administration ReactionsBoth systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and local injection-site reactions can occur with DARZALEXFASPRO. Systemic ReactionsIn a pooled safety population of 490patients who received DARZALEXFASPROas monotherapy or in combination, 11% of patients experienced a systemic administration-related reaction (Grade 2: 3.9%, Grade 3: 1.4%). Systemic administration-related reactions occurred in 10% of patients with the first injection, 0.2% with the second injection, and cumulatively 0.8% with subsequent injections. The median time to onset was 3.7hours (range: 9minutes to 3.5days). Of the 84systemic administration-related reactions that occurred in 52patients, 73(87%) occurred on the day of DARZALEXFASPROadministration. Delayed systemic administration-related reactions have occurred in less than 1% of the patients. Severe reactions included hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension and tachycardia. Other signs and symptoms of systemic administration-related reactions may include respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing, as well as anaphylactic reaction, pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, nausea, and hypotension. Pre-medicate patients with histamine-1 receptor antagonist, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Monitor patients for systemic administration-related reactions, especially following the first and second injections. For anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) administration-related reactions, immediately and permanently discontinue DARZALEXFASPRO.Consider administering corticosteroids and other medications after the administration of DARZALEXFASPROdepending on dosing regimen and medical history to minimize the risk of delayed (defined as occurring the day after administration) systemic administration-related reactions. Local ReactionsIn this pooled safety population, injection-site reactions occurred in 8% of patients, including Grade2 reactions in 0.6%. The most frequent (>1%) injection-site reaction was injection site erythema. These local reactions occurred a median of 7minutes (range: 0minutes to 4.7days) after starting administration of DARZALEXFASPRO. Monitor for local reactions and consider symptomatic management. NeutropeniaDaratumumab may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy.Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEXFASPROuntil recovery of neutrophils. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEXFASPRO, higher rates of Grade 3-4 neutropenia were observed. ThrombocytopeniaDaratumumab may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy.Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEXFASPROuntil recovery of platelets. Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on the mechanism of action, DARZALEXFASPROcan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEXFASPROmay cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEXFASPROand for 3months after the last dose. The combination of DARZALEXFASPROwith lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy. Interference with Serological TestingDaratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab administration. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEXFASPRO.Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEXFASPRO. Interference with Determination of Complete ResponseDaratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some DARZALEXFASPRO-treated patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reaction (20%) with DARZALEXFASPRO monotherapy is: upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse reactions with combination therapy (20% for any combination) include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, pyrexia, cough, muscle spasms, back pain, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral sensory neuropathy, constipation, and pneumonia. The most common hematology laboratory abnormalities (40%) with DARZALEXFASPROare decreased leukocytes, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased platelets, and decreased hemoglobin. Please see full Prescribing Information atwww.DARZALEX.com. DARZALEXIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS DARZALEX is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-Related Reactions DARZALEX can cause severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination: N=2066), infusion-related reactions occurred in 37% of patients with the Week1 (16mg/kg) infusion, 2% with the Week2 infusion, and cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade3/4 infusion-related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was 1.5hours (range: 0 to 73hours). Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4hours of completing DARZALEX. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema, and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting, and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension. When DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (CASSIOPEIA) for a median of 3.75months (range: 2.4 to 6.9months), upon re-initiation of DARZALEX, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was 11% for the first infusion following ASCT. Infusion-related reactions occurring at re-initiation of DARZALEX following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3 or 4: <1%) with those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. In EQUULEUS, patients receiving combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first 16mg/kg dose at Week 1 split over two days, ie, 8mg/kg on Day1 and Day2, respectively. The incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing infusion-related reactions on Day1 of Week1, 4% on Day2 of Week1, and 8% with subsequent infusions. Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion. To reduce the risk of delayed infusion-related reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interference With Serological Testing Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type is not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX. Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia DARZALEX may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of neutrophils or for recovery of platelets. Interference With Determination of Complete Response Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX and for 3 months after the last dose. The combination of DARZALEX with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence 20%) were: upper respiratory infection, neutropenia, infusionrelated reactions, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, constipation, anemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, cough, pyrexia, dyspnea, and asthenia. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities (40%) with DARZALEX are: neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia.

IMBRUVICA IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage: Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients who received IMBRUVICA. Majorhemorrhage ( Grade 3, serious, or any central nervous system events; e.g., intracranial hemorrhage [including subdural hematoma], gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post procedural hemorrhage) occurred in 4% of patients, with fatalities occurring in 0.4% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA in 27 clinical trials. Bleeding events, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in 39% of patients who received IMBRUVICA. The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. Use of either anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents concomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major hemorrhage. Across clinical trials, 3.1% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy experienced major hemorrhage. The addition of antiplatelet therapy with or without anticoagulant therapy increased this percentage to 4.4%, and the addition of anticoagulant therapy with or without antiplatelet therapy increased this percentage to 6.1%. Consider the risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding. Infections: Fatal and non-fatal infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 21% of 1,476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately. Cytopenias: In 645 patients with B-cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA as a single agent, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% and Grade 3 or 4 anemia in 3%, based on laboratory measurements. Monitor complete blood counts monthly. Cardiac Arrhythmias: Fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias have occurred with IMBRUVICA. Grade 3 or greater ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 0.2% of patients and Grade 3 or greater atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter occurred in 4% of 1,476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials. These events have occurred particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous history of cardiac arrhythmias. Periodically monitor patients clinically for cardiac arrhythmias. Obtain an ECG for patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, chest pain) or new onset dyspnea. Manage cardiac arrhythmias appropriately, and if it persists, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and follow dose modification guidelines. Hypertension: Hypertension occurred in 19% of 1,476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials. Grade 3 or greater hypertension occurred in 8% of patients. Based on data from 1,124 of these patients, the median time to onset was 5.9 months (range, 0.03 to 24 months). Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA and initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive medication throughout treatment with IMBRUVICA as appropriate. Second Primary Malignancies: Other malignancies (10%), including non-skin carcinomas (4%), occurred among the 1,476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (6%). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with IMBRUVICA. Assess the baseline risk (e.g., high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions. Monitor patients closely and treat as appropriate. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMBRUVICA and for 1 month after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during the same time period. ADVERSE REACTIONS B-cell malignancies: The most common adverse reactions (30%) in patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL/SLL, WM and MZL) were thrombocytopenia (54.5%)*, diarrhea (43.8%), fatigue (39.1%), musculoskeletal pain (38.8%), neutropenia (38.6%)*, rash (35.8%), anemia (35.0%)*, and bruising (32.0%). The most common Grade 3 adverse reactions (5%) in patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL/SLL, WM and MZL) were neutropenia (20.7%)*, thrombocytopenia (13.6%)*, pneumonia (8.2%), and hypertension (8.0%). Approximately 9% (CLL/SLL), 14% (MCL), 14% (WM) and 10% (MZL) of patients had a dose reduction due to adverse reactions. Approximately 4-10% (CLL/SLL), 9% (MCL), and 7% (WM [5%] and MZL [13%]) of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. cGVHD: The most common adverse reactions (20%) in patients with cGVHD were fatigue (57%), bruising (40%), diarrhea (36%), thrombocytopenia (33%)*, muscle spasms (29%), stomatitis (29%), nausea (26%), hemorrhage (26%), anemia (24%)*, and pneumonia (21%). The most common Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (5%) reported in patients with cGVHD were pneumonia (14%), fatigue (12%), diarrhea (10%), neutropenia (10%)*, sepsis (10%), hypokalemia (7%), headache (5%), musculoskeletal pain (5%), and pyrexia (5%). Twenty-four percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA in the cGVHD trial discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 26% of patients. *Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) were based on laboratory measurements. DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of IMBRUVICA with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations. Dose modifications of IMBRUVICA may be recommended when used concomitantly with posaconazole, voriconazole, and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid concomitant use of other strong CYP3A inhibitors. Interrupt IMBRUVICA if strong inhibitors are used short-term (e.g., for 7 days). See dose modification guidelines in USPI sections 2.3 and 7.1. CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers. SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic Impairment (based on Child-Pugh criteria): Avoid use of IMBRUVICA in patients with severe baseline hepatic impairment. In patients with mild or moderate impairment, reduce recommended IMBRUVICA dose and monitor more frequently for adverse reactions of IMBRUVICA. Please click here for full Prescribing Information.

This analysis is of particular importance as patients with CLI are at increased risk of major limb and CV events and many require unplanned revascularization.ii The following is a list of highlighted abstractsto be presented at AHA 2020: Abstract No. Title Date/Time/Location Late-Breaking/Featured Science Presentations FS.03 Efficacy and Safety of Rivaroxaban in Patients With PAD Undergoing Lower Extremity Revascularization for Critical Limb Ischemia: Insights from VOYAGER PAD November 14, 2020 3:42-3:54 p.m. CT* FS.03 Rivaroxaban Plus Aspirin Versus Aspirin Alone After Endovascular Revascularization for Symptomatic PAD: Insights From VOYAGER PAD November 14, 2020 3:54-4:06 p.m. CT* FS.03 Efficacy and Safety of Rivaroxaban Monotherapy in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation After Coronary Stenting: Insights From the Afire Trial November 14, 2020 4:18-4:30 p.m. CT* LBS.03 Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin in Patients With Bioprosthetic Mitral Valves and Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter: Primary Results From the RIVER Randomized Trial RIVER Trial November 14, 2020 12:40-12:50 p.m. CT LBS.06 3-year Clinical Outcomes in a Nationwide, Randomized, Pragmatic Clinical Trial of Atrial Fibrillation Screening - Mhealth Screening To Prevent Strokes (mSToPS) November 16, 2020 9:21-9:29 a.m. CT Vascular Protection 291 Reduction in Venous Thromboembolism With Rivaroxaban Versus Placebo in Peripheral Artery Disease After Lower Extremity Revascularization: Insights from VOYAGER PAD November 13, 2020 9:00-10:00 a.m. CT* 293 Rivaroxaban Reduces Major Cardiovascular and Limb Events in Patients With the High-Risk Triad of Chronic Kidney Disease, Peripheral Artery Disease and Recent Lower Extremity Revascularization: Insights From VOYAGER PAD November 13, 2020 9:00-10:00 a.m. CT* P1714 Incidence and Costs of Major Atherothrombotic Vascular Events Among Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease After Revascularization November 13, 2020 9:00-10:00 a.m. CT* Stroke Prevention P1089 Advanced Age and Preferential Use of Vitamin K Antagonists in Severe Renal Impairment: First Results of the XARENO Registry in Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation and Non-Dialysis Dependent Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease November 13, 2020 9:00-10:00 a.m. CT* P1971 Oral Anticoagulation Use in High-Risk Atrial Fibrillation Patients is Much Higher than Previously Reported November 13, 2020 9:00-10:00 a.m. CT* *Available on demand for the duration of the Congress About Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)Peripheral artery disease is a narrowing of the peripheral arteries serving the legs, arms and head.

WHAT IS XARELTO? XARELTO is a prescription medicine used to: reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people who have a medical condition called atrial fibrillation that is not caused by a heart valve problem. With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE) reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months help prevent a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had hip or knee replacement surgery help prevent blood clots in certain people hospitalized for an acute illness and after discharge, who are at risk of getting blood clots because of the loss of or decreased ability to move around (mobility) and other risks for getting blood clots, and who do not have a high risk of bleeding XARELTO is used with low dose aspirin to: reduce the risk of serious heart problems, heart attack and stroke in people with coronary artery disease (a condition where the blood supply to the heart is reduced or blocked) or peripheral artery disease (a condition where the blood flow to the legs is reduced) It is not known if XARELTOis safe and effective in children. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT XARELTO? XARELTOmay cause serious side effects, including: Increased risk of blood clots if you stop taking XARELTO. People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) that is not caused by a heart valve problem (nonvalvular) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTOlowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.Do not stop taking XARELTOwithout talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTOincreases your risk of having a stroke.If you have to stop taking XARELTO, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming. Increased risk of bleeding.XARELTOcan cause bleeding which can be serious, and may lead to death. This is because XARELTO is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that lowers blood clotting. During treatment with XARELTO you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. You may be at higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO and have certain other medical problems. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including: Aspirin or aspirin-containing products Long-term (chronic) use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Jantoven) Any medicine that contains heparin Clopidogrel (Plavix) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above. Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding: Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as: Nosebleeds that happen often Unusual bleeding from gums Menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding Bleeding that is severe or you cannot control Red, pink, or brown urine Bright red or black stools (looks like tar) Cough up blood or blood clots Vomit blood or your vomit looks like ""coffee grounds"" Headaches, feeling dizzy or weak Pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma). People who take a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) like XARELTO, and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if: A thin tube called an epidural catheter is placed in your back to give you certain medicine You take NSAIDs or a medicine to prevent blood from clotting You have a history of difficult or repeated epidural or spinal punctures You have a history of problems with your spine or have had surgery on your spine If you take XARELTO and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots. Tell your doctor right away if you have back pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), or loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence). XARELTO is not for use in people with artificial heart valves. XARELTO is not for use in people with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially with positive triple antibody testing, who have a history of blood clots. Do not take XARELTO if you: Currently have certain types of abnormal bleeding. Talk to your doctor before taking XARELTO if you currently have unusual bleeding. Are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the ingredients of XARELTO. Before taking XARELTO, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: Have ever had bleeding problems Have liver or kidney problems Have antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if XARELTO will harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant during treatment with XARELTO. Taking XARELTO while you are pregnant may increase the risk of bleeding in you or in your unborn baby. If you take XARELTO during pregnancy, tell your doctor right away if you have any signs or symptoms of bleeding or blood loss.

Being nationally recognized for helping women and their families in the fight against these injustices, Select Justice has, to date, helped over 5,000 women to join the fight against Johnson and Johnson for selling and marketing a dangerous product that was known to contain asbestos. ""The current $100 million agreed by Johnson and Johnson to settle over 1000 lawsuits marks the first time that J&J is settling a bulk of cases vs individual ones,"" states Ben Slor, Vice President of Select Justice. ""This is monumental and allows the public concern over J&J\'s Baby Powder to move forward quickly. Additionally, we are proud to support our Make a Difference Scholarship.

With this recent reported announcement, ovarian cancer claims are moving forward at a rapid pace claiming J&J\'s Baby Powder contains cancer-causing asbestos. The claims are largely based on the fact that Johnson & Johnson failed to warn women about the risk of developing ovarian cancer by using its products for feminine hygiene. This has led to many people seeking justice for harm that may have come to them or a loved one due to the company\'s failure to warn them and deliberately marketing to the health & wellbeing of women.

The Europe anti-viral therapies market is expected to reach US$ 21,122.66 million by 2027 from US$ 11,401.67 million in 2019; it is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 8.1% during 2020-2027. The market is growth is primarily attributed to the increasing R&D expenditures in pharmaceutical companies and rising government support for research activities and clinical trials in Europe. Additionally, strong pipeline of anti-viral drugs, and growing emphasis on launching anti-viral agents are likely to fuel the growth of the Europe anti-viral therapies market during the forecast period. High cost of drug development is a key factor restraining the growth of the market. Antiviral therapy is one of the most exciting branches of virology. These therapies are based on several strategies - direct-acting antivirals target viral proteins, enzymes, or nucleic acids; passive antibodies neutralize circulating viruses; and several other antivirals target cellular proteins or processes essential for viral replication. Research and development (R&D) is an essential part of any business. Pharmaceutical companies focus on R&D to introduce new drugs with enhanced medical and commercial potential. These companies invest majorly in R&D activities with an aim to deliver high-quality and innovative products in the market. As per the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Pharmaceutical R&D expenditures grew by >11% in the UK in 2001, reaching an estimated US$ 5.23 billion. Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer are among the top 10 leading R&D investing companies. The UK\'s relative stability compared to the rest of Europe as a base for investment to an increase in R&D activity there by the three largest pharmaceutical investors. AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer collectively signify over 70% of total R&D spending in the UK, while other manufacturers with a significant presence in the country include Merck, Sharp & Dohme, Organon, Eli Lilly, and Novartis. Additionally, the pharma companies in the Germany are highly engaged in R&D activities. Europe has witnessed exponential growth in the count of COVID-19 cases. Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and the UK are among the most affected European countries. Growing research activities to develop treatment against corona virus is likely to favor the growth of the market in this region. In June 2020, the scientists from the University of Oxford tested existing drugs as therapies against this novel virus. Further, the European Commission in July authorized the anti-viral drug Remdesivir for its use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, making it the first approved drug in the European Union for the treatment. In 2019, the branded drugs segment accounted for a larger share of the Europe antiviral therapies market. The branded antiviral drugs are more trusted than the generic drugs. Further, robust research and development activities, increasing number of drug discoveries, and rising number of patents for drugs are the factors supporting the growth of this segment.

The Europe anti-viral therapies market is expected to reach US$ 21,122.66 million by 2027 from US$ 11,401.67 million in 2019; it is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 8.1% during 2020-2027. The market is growth is primarily attributed to the increasing R&D expenditures in pharmaceutical companies and rising government support for research activities and clinical trials in Europe. Additionally, strong pipeline of anti-viral drugs, and growing emphasis on launching anti-viral agents are likely to fuel the growth of the Europe anti-viral therapies market during the forecast period. High cost of drug development is a key factor restraining the growth of the market. Antiviral therapy is one of the most exciting branches of virology. These therapies are based on several strategies - direct-acting antivirals target viral proteins, enzymes, or nucleic acids; passive antibodies neutralize circulating viruses; and several other antivirals target cellular proteins or processes essential for viral replication. Research and development (R&D) is an essential part of any business. Pharmaceutical companies focus on R&D to introduce new drugs with enhanced medical and commercial potential. These companies invest majorly in R&D activities with an aim to deliver high-quality and innovative products in the market. As per the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Pharmaceutical R&D expenditures grew by >11% in the UK in 2001, reaching an estimated US$ 5.23 billion. Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer are among the top 10 leading R&D investing companies. The UK\'s relative stability compared to the rest of Europe as a base for investment to an increase in R&D activity there by the three largest pharmaceutical investors. AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer collectively signify over 70% of total R&D spending in the UK, while other manufacturers with a significant presence in the country include Merck, Sharp & Dohme, Organon, Eli Lilly, and Novartis. Additionally, the pharma companies in the Germany are highly engaged in R&D activities. Europe has witnessed exponential growth in the count of COVID-19 cases. Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and the UK are among the most affected European countries. Growing research activities to develop treatment against corona virus is likely to favor the growth of the market in this region. In June 2020, the scientists from the University of Oxford tested existing drugs as therapies against this novel virus. Further, the European Commission in July authorized the anti-viral drug Remdesivir for its use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, making it the first approved drug in the European Union for the treatment. In 2019, the branded drugs segment accounted for a larger share of the Europe antiviral therapies market. The branded antiviral drugs are more trusted than the generic drugs. Further, robust research and development activities, increasing number of drug discoveries, and rising number of patents for drugs are the factors supporting the growth of this segment.

After decades of research, drugs like psilocybin and ketamine are finally ready to move from the lab into the pharmacy and the therapist\'s office. Several psychedelic treatments have already received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including Johnson & Johnson\'s (NYSE:JNJ) ketamine-life depression drug, and more are likely to follow suit in the years to come. Now that the FDA has come to realize the potential benefits of psychedelic medicines, pioneering biotechnology companies like Compass Pathways (NASDAQ:CMPS), Numinus Wellness Inc. (TSXV:NUMI) (OTCPK:LKYSF), Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NEO:MMED) (OTCQB:MMEDF), and Mydecine Innovations Group Inc. (CSE:MYCO) (MYCOF)have the opportunity to take the progress made by researchers and transition it into market-ready pharmaceutical products. Mydecine Innovations Group Inc. (CSE:MYCO) (MYCOF) is an emerging biopharma and life sciences company that is committed to the research, development and acceptance of alternative nature-sourced medicine. Through its portfolio of companies and experienced leadership team, Mydecine Innovations is looking to provide the mental health industry with innovative solutions. Health Crisis Highlights Growing Need for Alternative Treatments for Mental Illness Since the start of the global pandemic, the healthcare system has taken a beating as frontline workers struggled to keep up with the rising cases while still providing care for those with other illnesses. The crisis has also led to an all-time high in anxiety and depression in the US, with 47.1 million Americans (19%) now living with a mental health condition, including front line workers, who are also at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mydecine Innovations Group Inc. is looking to tackle the problem from all angles through its clinical trials and digital mental health platform. On November 17, Mydecine announced the international expansion of its Phase 2A clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to treat chronic PTSD in veterans and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. The trials, which will take place at prominent medical centers in Ontario, Alberta, the Netherlands, along with four other trial sites developing in the US and the UK, will be used to explore how the brain responds to psychedelics and develop a better understanding of the biological underpinnings of the experience. Mydecine Innovations plans to use the data from the studies to build on its data in the hopes of receiving FDA breakthrough designation. The company also bolstered its leadership team with the appointment of its new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Rakesh Jetly, a medical advocate for the use of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and a prominent voice in the fight against PTSD and other mental health issues. Apart from its efforts to cultivate and develop psychedelic therapies to combat mental illness, Mydecine Innovations has launched a mental health-focused telehealth digital platform to assist therapy patients with psychedelic aftercare, track moods, and combat addiction. Mindleap, which is available on iOS and Android, is an AI-powered first-to-market digital health platform designed by clinical psychologists and neuroscientists that combines telehealth with mood, emotion, and habit tracking. The Mindleap Health app allows Mydecine to increase access to much-needed mental health services, while at the same time gaining a piece of the growing telehealth industry, which is projected to become a $560 billion market by 2027. FDA Gives Green Light to Psychedelic-Based Treatments for Depression The psychedelic medicine market has come a long way in the last couple of years, with regulators jumping on board and fast tracking novel treatments based on a variety of psychedelics, and companies getting the go-ahead to do more in-depth research into psychedelics. One such company making headway with its clinical research is neuro-pharmaceutical company Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NEO:MMED) (OTCQB:MMEDF). Earlier this month, the company completed the Phase 1 LSD study in partnership with University Hospital Basel\'s Liechti Lab in Switzerland. MindMed is now preparing for Phase 2b of Project Lucy, which intends to evaluate the efficacy of LSD-assisted therapy for anxiety disorders and other medical conditions. The Phase 1 study used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 16 healthy participants to measure LSD dose-dependently induced subjective responses starting at microdoses (25 ug) up to experiential doses (200 ug). Apart from preparing for Phase 2b, MindMed and University Hospital Basel are also actively filing patent applications on clinical trial data generated through its clinical trials and R&D. In 2018, recently listed life sciences company Compass Pathways (NASDAQ:CMPS) was given breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for its psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression. The company has since been granted a US patent for its synthesized investigational formulation and is conducting Phase 2b trials. The first public company to gain FDA approval for a psychedelic-based treatment was pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The company\'s Spravato esketamine nasal spray, which is used in conjunction with an oral antidepressant to treat treatment-resistant depression (TRD), gained FDA approval in March 2019. Several other novel drug developers have since followed suit thanks to growing interest in the sector. In June 2020, Numinus Wellness Inc. (TSXV:NUMI) (OTCPK:LKYSD) became the first publicly-traded company in Canada to be granted a licence by Health Canada to conduct research to standardize the extraction of psilocybin from mushrooms. This approval allows the company to move forward with the production of naturally-sourced psilocybin from mushrooms to support psychedelic-assisted therapy and research at lower costs than the currently-produced synthetic psilocybin. Mydecine Innovations is preparing to start its Phase 2a clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to treat chronic PTSD in veterans and EMS personnel. The trials will be conducted at Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, the University of Western Ontario, and the University of Alberta, but the company is also exploring additional trial sites across North America including Los Angeles, New York, Boston and Ottawa.

Major players in the COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics clinical trial analysis market are Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), Novavax Inc., Heat Biologics, Sanofi, BioNTech, Vaxart, and Vir Biotechnology. The urgent need to develop vaccines or therapeutics in response to the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in a significant increase in clinical trials worldwide. Many research institutes, healthcare organizations and biopharmaceutical companies worldwide are conducting clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. According to the ClinicalTrials.gov database, there are more than 1,300 clinical trials registered (195 in phase I, 817 in phase II, 442 in phase III, 188 in phase IV). For instance, \'Solidarity\' is an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19 launched by the World Health Organization and its partners. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics clinical trial analysis report consists of drugs and vaccines which are under clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The various drugs and vaccines trials are categorized under 4 phases i.e. Phase I (drug or vaccine safety is tested on a small group of humans), Phase II (efficacy and safety are tested on a large group of humans), Phase III (efficacy and safety are tested on thousands of humans), and Phase IV (obtaining government approval and market launch, many vaccines undergo more monitoring). By region, Europe registered the highest number of trials (616 trials), followed by the Americas (418). Asia-pacific registered around 158 trials, and the Middle-East and Africa registered about 137 trials. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics clinical trial analysis covered in this report is segmented by product type into small molecules, biologics, blood & plasma derivatives, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, others. It is also segmented by the phase of development into clinical phase I (active trial & discontinued trials), clinical phase II (active trial & discontinued trials), clinical phase III (active trial & discontinued trials), clinical phase IV (active trial & discontinued trials), by route of administration into oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, other routes of administration, and by type of sponsor into pharma/biotech company, academic research/institution, others (such as Government Organizations and CROs). In June 2020, Moderna Inc. collaborated with Catalent to fill-finish manufacturing of Moderna\'s COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The collaboration is expected to utilize Catalent filling and packaging capacity and staffing for manufacturing operations for producing an initial 100 million doses of the vaccine. Moderna Inc is a clinical-stage biotechnology organization that spent significant time in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and immunizations to make another age of transformative drugs. Catalent is the main supplier of cutting-edge conveyance advances, improvement, manufacturing drugs, biologics, cell, and quality treatments. The long and costly drug development process is anticipated to limit the growth of the COVID-19 vaccine & therapeutics clinical trials in the coming days. The safety and efficacy of drugs and vaccines are tested in various stages of the clinical trials. A vaccine takes an average of two to five years to develop. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the average cost of research and development of a new drug is approximately $2.6 billion. Moreover, the stringent regulations imposed by the various regulatory authorities such as European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in regards with clinical trials during COVID-19 outbreak attributing to the safety of trial participants, maintaining compliance with good clinical practice, and minimizing risks to trial integrity is a major challenge faced in COVID-19 vaccine & therapeutics clinical trials. New programs launched by companies and organizations to develop vaccines for protection against COVID-19 are expected to be a major trend shaping the growth of the COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics clinical trials. For instance, in March 2020, Heat Biologics Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of therapeutic vaccines, announced the launch of a program within its subsidiary Zolovax, Inc. to develop a vaccine using its immune-activating gp96 vaccine platform for prevention and treatment against SARS-CoV-2 that causes coronavirus. Various programs being launched by the companies are likely to act as a key factor driving the COVID-19 vaccines & therapeutics clinical trials in the coming days. Key Topics Covered: 1.

Financial terms of the transaction with Hemera Biosciences, a privately-owned biotechnology company, are not being disclosed. Continue Reading Normal Vision As the individuals sight worsens, it creates a blur in their central vision, making it difficult to read and recognize faces. Geographic Atrophy - Central Vision Loss Anatomy of geographic atrophy Experience the interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8803451-janssen-acquires-rights-to-novel-gene-therapy-late-stage-amd/ Patients with AMD often have low levels of CD59, a protein that protects the retina from damage caused by an essential part of the body\'s natural immune response called ""complement."" In geographic atrophy, an overactivity of complement destroys cells in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for central vision and seeing fine details, and results in a relentless progression to blindness. HMR59 is designed to increase the ability of retina cells to make a soluble form of CD59, helping to prevent further damage to the retina and preserve vision. Geographic atrophy affects five millionipeople globally, and is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50 years of age. The prevalence of geographic atrophy increases as the global population ages with roughlyone in 29people overage 75affected, and nearlyone in four people overage 90. There are currently no available therapies other than vitamins and low vision aids. ""Geographic atrophy is a devastating form of AMD that impacts the ability to accomplish everyday tasks, such as reading, driving, cooking, or even seeing faces,"" said James F. List, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""Our aim with this novel, single-administration gene therapy is to use our development expertise and deep heritage in vision care to help improve patient outcomes by intervening early, halting the progression to blindness, and preserving more years of sight."" Gene therapy is an important modality for both therapeutic delivery and protein replacement, and one of the ways Janssen aims to significantly improve health outcomes for patients. Beginning with the eye, Janssen is rapidly developing expertise in the manufacturing, development, and commercialization of gene therapies across a range of mechanisms of action, building the case for future applications to other parts of the body.""At Janssen, we pursue the best science to uncover transformational treatments that meet patient needs, which often means pioneering the solution. This is especially the case with gene therapy and late-stage eye diseases where the paths are largely uncharted,"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. ""Through this acquisition, we are blazing the trail to bring innovative solutions to patients who are losing their vision."" The Phase 1 studyof HMR59 for patients with geographic atrophy is complete. A second Phase 1 study exploring HMR59 in patients with wet-AMD is currently conducting follow-up visits to evaluate long-term safety.About Janssen\'s Eye Disease PortfolioJanssen is committed to innovating the eye disease space, translating the biology underlying eye diseases, and pioneering gene therapy solutions to develop treatments that preserve and enhance vision. The Company established its eye disease portfolio in 2018 and is developing expertise and assets across a range of rare and common eye diseases, including achromatopsia and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema.

The application marks the first-ever regulatory submission for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.1 The Company has also established an expanded access program (EAP) [NCT04599712]2 for patients in the U.S. who may be eligible to obtain access to amivantamab during review of the BLA. For information about Janssens pre-approval access program, visit https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access. Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications.3,4,5,6 In March 2020, amivantamab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for this population.7 This submission marks an important step forward in our drive toward evolving the treatment landscape for patients with NSCLC who have EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and for whom there are no FDA-approved targeted treatment options, said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. We are committed to the development of therapies like amivantamab that progress precision medicine and target specific pathways, and to providing access through expanded access programs. The BLA submission for amivantamab is based on data from the monotherapy arm of the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of amivantamab as a monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib*, a novel third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)8, in adult patients with advanced NSCLC.9 In the study, investigators assessed efficacy using overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1** (RECIST v1.1), clinical benefit rate, and duration of response and progression-free survival, as well as the safety profile of amivantamab.8,10 Early data about amivantamab as a monotherapy treatment in patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2020 Virtual Scientific Program (Abstract #9512).10 Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Given this significant unmet need, we at Johnson & Johnson are committed to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with this complex, deadly disease. With todays submission for amivantamab, we are one step closer to that goal, said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. We are steadfast in our focus to advance novel therapeutics and medicines that will transform the trajectory of some of the most challenging and deadly diseases of our time, including lung cancer. EGFR mutations, leading to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and division11, are some of the most common mutations in NSCLC.12 EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most prevalent primary EGFR mutation.13 However, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are also often undetected.13 Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is effective at detecting EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and broader use of NGS can help to detect these mutations.14 Cancer driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is generally insensitive to approved EGFR TKI treatments and, in addition, carries a worse prognosis compared with cancer driven by more common EGFR mutations, including exon 19 deletions/L858R substitutions.15 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a median survival of less than 17 months16, which is much shorter than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations, who have a median survival of 32-39 months.17 *In 2018, Janssen entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib. **RECIST (version 1.1) refers to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, which is a standard way to measure how well solid tumors respond to treatment and is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same, or get bigger. About Amivantamab Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications.3,4,5,6 Amivantamab is pending regulatory review as a potential treatment for patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose tumors typically do not respond to current standard of care. Companion diagnostics to identify patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have been an integral part of the development program for amivantamab. The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBody technology platform. About the Amivantamab Expanded Access Program Protocol (EAP) The amivantamab EAP is for U.S. patients 18 years of age or older who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who are not amenable to curative therapy and whose disease has progressed during or after current standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy, who may benefit from treatment with amivantamab prior to its potential FDA approval.2 The EAP has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients to be considered for enrollment in the program, and patients must not be eligible for another amivantamab study.2 Interested patients should contact their physician to discuss whether they may be a candidate for amivantamab through the EAP.2 Additional information about the expanded access protocol can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04599712) and at https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access. About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer, and NSCLC makes up 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.18,19 The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.19 Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase supporting cell growth and division.11 EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of patients with NSCLC and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients who have NSCLC adenocarcinoma.20 The five-year survival rate for all patients with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent.21,22 Estimated median overall survival for patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is shorter than in patients with common EGFR mutations.11 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past. Were the Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, working tirelessly to make that future a reality for patients everywhere by fighting sickness with science, improving access with ingenuity and healing hopelessness with heart.

Financial terms of the transaction with Hemera Biosciences, a privately-owned biotechnology company, are not being disclosed. Continue Reading Normal Vision As the individuals sight worsens, it creates a blur in their central vision, making it difficult to read and recognize faces. Geographic Atrophy - Central Vision Loss Anatomy of geographic atrophy Experience the interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8803451-janssen-acquires-rights-to-novel-gene-therapy-late-stage-amd/ Patients with AMD often have low levels of CD59, a protein that protects the retina from damage caused by an essential part of the body\'s natural immune response called ""complement."" In geographic atrophy, an overactivity of complement destroys cells in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for central vision and seeing fine details, and results in a relentless progression to blindness. HMR59 is designed to increase the ability of retina cells to make a soluble form of CD59, helping to prevent further damage to the retina and preserve vision. Geographic atrophy affects five millionipeople globally, and is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50 years of age. The prevalence of geographic atrophy increases as the global population ages with roughlyone in 29people overage 75affected, and nearlyone in four people overage 90. There are currently no available therapies other than vitamins and low vision aids. ""Geographic atrophy is a devastating form of AMD that impacts the ability to accomplish everyday tasks, such as reading, driving, cooking, or even seeing faces,"" said James F. List, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""Our aim with this novel, single-administration gene therapy is to use our development expertise and deep heritage in vision care to help improve patient outcomes by intervening early, halting the progression to blindness, and preserving more years of sight."" Gene therapy is an important modality for both therapeutic delivery and protein replacement, and one of the ways Janssen aims to significantly improve health outcomes for patients. Beginning with the eye, Janssen is rapidly developing expertise in the manufacturing, development, and commercialization of gene therapies across a range of mechanisms of action, building the case for future applications to other parts of the body.""At Janssen, we pursue the best science to uncover transformational treatments that meet patient needs, which often means pioneering the solution. This is especially the case with gene therapy and late-stage eye diseases where the paths are largely uncharted,"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. ""Through this acquisition, we are blazing the trail to bring innovative solutions to patients who are losing their vision."" The Phase 1 studyof HMR59 for patients with geographic atrophy is complete. A second Phase 1 study exploring HMR59 in patients with wet-AMD is currently conducting follow-up visits to evaluate long-term safety.About Janssen\'s Eye Disease PortfolioJanssen is committed to innovating the eye disease space, translating the biology underlying eye diseases, and pioneering gene therapy solutions to develop treatments that preserve and enhance vision. The Company established its eye disease portfolio in 2018 and is developing expertise and assets across a range of rare and common eye diseases, including achromatopsia and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema.

Financial terms of the transaction with Hemera Biosciences, a privately-owned biotechnology company, are not being disclosed. Continue Reading Normal Vision As the individuals sight worsens, it creates a blur in their central vision, making it difficult to read and recognize faces. Geographic Atrophy - Central Vision Loss Anatomy of geographic atrophy Experience the interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8803451-janssen-acquires-rights-to-novel-gene-therapy-late-stage-amd/ Patients with AMD often have low levels of CD59, a protein that protects the retina from damage caused by an essential part of the body\'s natural immune response called ""complement."" In geographic atrophy, an overactivity of complement destroys cells in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for central vision and seeing fine details, and results in a relentless progression to blindness. HMR59 is designed to increase the ability of retina cells to make a soluble form of CD59, helping to prevent further damage to the retina and preserve vision. Geographic atrophy affects five millionipeople globally, and is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50 years of age. The prevalence of geographic atrophy increases as the global population ages with roughlyone in 29people overage 75affected, and nearlyone in four people overage 90. There are currently no available therapies other than vitamins and low vision aids. ""Geographic atrophy is a devastating form of AMD that impacts the ability to accomplish everyday tasks, such as reading, driving, cooking, or even seeing faces,"" said James F. List, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""Our aim with this novel, single-administration gene therapy is to use our development expertise and deep heritage in vision care to help improve patient outcomes by intervening early, halting the progression to blindness, and preserving more years of sight."" Gene therapy is an important modality for both therapeutic delivery and protein replacement, and one of the ways Janssen aims to significantly improve health outcomes for patients. Beginning with the eye, Janssen is rapidly developing expertise in the manufacturing, development, and commercialization of gene therapies across a range of mechanisms of action, building the case for future applications to other parts of the body.""At Janssen, we pursue the best science to uncover transformational treatments that meet patient needs, which often means pioneering the solution. This is especially the case with gene therapy and late-stage eye diseases where the paths are largely uncharted,"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. ""Through this acquisition, we are blazing the trail to bring innovative solutions to patients who are losing their vision."" The Phase 1 studyof HMR59 for patients with geographic atrophy is complete. A second Phase 1 study exploring HMR59 in patients with wet-AMD is currently conducting follow-up visits to evaluate long-term safety.About Janssen\'s Eye Disease PortfolioJanssen is committed to innovating the eye disease space, translating the biology underlying eye diseases, and pioneering gene therapy solutions to develop treatments that preserve and enhance vision.

The application marks the first-ever regulatory submission for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.1 The Company has also established an expanded access program (EAP) [NCT04599712]2 for patients in the U.S. who may be eligible to obtain access to amivantamab during review of the BLA. For information about Janssens pre-approval access program, visit https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access. Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications.3,4,5,6 In March 2020, amivantamab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for this population.7 This submission marks an important step forward in our drive toward evolving the treatment landscape for patients with NSCLC who have EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and for whom there are no FDA-approved targeted treatment options, said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. We are committed to the development of therapies like amivantamab that progress precision medicine and target specific pathways, and to providing access through expanded access programs. The BLA submission for amivantamab is based on data from the monotherapy arm of the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of amivantamab as a monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib*, a novel third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)8, in adult patients with advanced NSCLC.9 In the study, investigators assessed efficacy using overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1** (RECIST v1.1), clinical benefit rate, and duration of response and progression-free survival, as well as the safety profile of amivantamab.8,10 Early data about amivantamab as a monotherapy treatment in patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2020 Virtual Scientific Program (Abstract #9512).10 Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Given this significant unmet need, we at Johnson & Johnson are committed to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with this complex, deadly disease. With todays submission for amivantamab, we are one step closer to that goal, said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. We are steadfast in our focus to advance novel therapeutics and medicines that will transform the trajectory of some of the most challenging and deadly diseases of our time, including lung cancer. EGFR mutations, leading to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and division11, are some of the most common mutations in NSCLC.12 EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most prevalent primary EGFR mutation.13 However, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are also often undetected.13 Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is effective at detecting EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and broader use of NGS can help to detect these mutations.14 Cancer driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is generally insensitive to approved EGFR TKI treatments and, in addition, carries a worse prognosis compared with cancer driven by more common EGFR mutations, including exon 19 deletions/L858R substitutions.15 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a median survival of less than 17 months16, which is much shorter than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations, who have a median survival of 32-39 months.17 *In 2018, Janssen entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib. **RECIST (version 1.1) refers to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, which is a standard way to measure how well solid tumors respond to treatment and is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same, or get bigger. About Amivantamab Amivantamab is an investigational, fully-human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumors with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications.3,4,5,6 Amivantamab is pending regulatory review as a potential treatment for patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose tumors typically do not respond to current standard of care. Companion diagnostics to identify patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have been an integral part of the development program for amivantamab. The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBody technology platform. About the Amivantamab Expanded Access Program Protocol (EAP) The amivantamab EAP is for U.S. patients 18 years of age or older who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who are not amenable to curative therapy and whose disease has progressed during or after current standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy, who may benefit from treatment with amivantamab prior to its potential FDA approval.2 The EAP has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients to be considered for enrollment in the program, and patients must not be eligible for another amivantamab study.2 Interested patients should contact their physician to discuss whether they may be a candidate for amivantamab through the EAP.2 Additional information about the expanded access protocol can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04599712) and at https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-use-pre-approval-access. About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer, and NSCLC makes up 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.18,19 The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.19 Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase supporting cell growth and division.11 EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of patients with NSCLC and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients who have NSCLC adenocarcinoma.20 The five-year survival rate for all patients with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent.21,22 Estimated median overall survival for patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is shorter than in patients with common EGFR mutations.11 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

J Thorac Oncol. 2016 Apr;11(4):556-65.', 'BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced results of the Phase 3 APOLLO study showing that the addition of DARZALEX (daratumumab) subcutaneous (SC) formulation to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Pd) significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 37 percent, compared to Pd alone in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after the first or subsequent relapse of disease.1 The APOLLO results, which will be presented on Sunday, December 6 at 9:00 p.m. CET during the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting and featured in the ASH press briefing (Abstract #112), add to the body of evidence supporting treatment with daratumumab SC-based regimens for patients with relapsed MM. These data were the basis for recent regulatory submissions in Europe and the United States (U.S.) seeking approval for daratumumab SC in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MM, with two or more prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI).2 For patients with multiple myeloma who relapse, it is important that efficacious treatments significantly reduce the risk of progression. The data presented at ASH makes D-Pd a compelling treatment option for early relapsed or lenalidomide refractory patients, said Meletios A. Dimopoulos, M.D.,* Professor and Chairman of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece, and principal investigator. The APOLLO study also highlights the potential benefits of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, which offers patients and physicians a three- to five-minute injection experience and the potential to reduce infusion-related reactions compared to intravenous administration of daratumumab. Key Findings from the APOLLO Oral Presentation (Abstract #412): The safety profile of D-Pd is consistent with known profiles of daratumumab SC and Pd. The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neutropenia (68% vs. 51%), anaemia (17% vs. 21%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs. 18%), and leukopenia (17% vs. 5%). The most common serious TEAEs were pneumonia (13% vs. 7%) and lower respiratory tract infection (11% vs. 9%).1 Despite much progress over the last decade, multiple myeloma remains a disease with considerable unmet need, with many patients progressing or relapsing on their initial treatment, said Dr Catherine Taylor, VP, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. At Janssen, we continually strive to address the complex needs of these patients and are devoted to pursuing new treatment formulations, such as daratumumab SC, as part of different treatment regimens. We are encouraged by the efficacy of this combination with daratumumab SC, which has improved outcomes over pomalidomide-dexamethasone, a widely used regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have received prior treatment with lenalidomide, said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Together with the reduced infusion time for patients receiving daratumumab SC as compared to the intravenous formulation, the APOLLO study results further solidify this differentiated anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody as a foundational treatment in multiple myeloma for patients who are in need of additional treatment options. *Meletios A. Dimopoulos is lead investigator of the APOLLO study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About the APOLLO Study3 APOLLO (NCT01960348) is an ongoing multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, open-label study comparing daratumumab SC, pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment regimen with both lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression. The study, which was conducted in collaboration with the European Myeloma Network, enrolled 304 participants. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints include rates of overall response rate (ORR), very good partial response (VGPR) or better, complete response (CR) or better and duration of response, among others. The study reinforces findings from the Phase 1b EQUULEUS (MMY1001) trial, which formed the grounds for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of intravenous D-Pd in 2017 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In November 2020, Janssen submitted regulatory applications to the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of the combination of D-Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with 2 prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a PI. About daratumumab and daratumumab SC In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab. Since launch, it is estimated that more than 150,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.4 Daratumumab is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to be given subcutaneously to treat patients with multiple myeloma. Daratumumab SC is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\'s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.5 CD38 is a surface protein that is highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease. Daratumumab SC binds to CD38 and induces myeloma cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), as well as through apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death.6 Data across nine Phase 3 clinical trials in multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) amyloidosis, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that daratumumab-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Additional studies have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of daratumumab SC in the treatment of other malignant and pre-malignant haematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, including smouldering myeloma.16 For further information on daratumumab, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/darzalex. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.17 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.18 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,19,20 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.21 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.22 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.23 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.24 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.25 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

Media Contact Marisa Garcia de Celis, [emailprotected] SOURCE We Are All Human', 'HORSHAM, Pa., Dec. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced new data from the randomized Phase 2 GRIFFIN study showing that the addition of DARZALEX (daratumumab) to lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (VELCADE) and dexamethasone (D-RVd), followed by DARZALEXplus lenalidomide (D-R) maintenance therapy, resulted in deeper and improved responses, including minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, compared to RVd followed by R alone in newly diagnosed, stem cell transplant-eligible patients with multiple myeloma.1These data investigating the use of DARZALEX in combination with RVd, which were shared in separate oral and poster presentations at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting, provide further evidence that this regimen may provide greater efficacy for transplant-eligible, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma(NDMM) than standard therapy. The oral presentation (Abstract #549) shared longer-term follow-up data, and the poster presentation (Abstract #3243) featured additional data from the safety run-in cohort.1,2 ""The long-term GRIFFIN data show that maintenance therapy with DARZALEX in combination with lenalidomide (D-R) resulted in deeper responses compared to R alone in patients with multiple myeloma who are newly diagnosed and transplant-eligible,"" said Peter Voorhees, M.D., Atrium Health\'s Levine Cancer Institute and GRIFFIN study investigator. ""These data indicate that the addition of DARZALEX to RVd followed by R maintenance results in improved response rates and depth of response during induction, consolidation and maintenance treatment cycles."" Key Findings from GRIFFIN (Abstract #549):The GRIFFIN oral presentation featured updated safety and efficacy data based onlonger follow-up for D-RVd and evaluated the potential role of D-R for maintenance therapy in patients with NDMM.1 Initial findings of GRIFFIN: At the end of post-transplant consolidation (median follow-up, 13.5 months) in the response-evaluable population, the stringent complete response (sCR) rate favored D-RVd vs. RVd (42.4 percent vs. 32.0 percent; P=0.0253).1 The complete response (CR) or better rate also favored D-RVd vs. RVd (51.5 percent vs. 42.3 percent; P=0.0014).1 With an additional 12 months of D-R or R maintenance therapy (median follow-up of 27.4 months), responses continued to deepen and remained higher for the DARZALEX-containing arm:1 At the clinical cutoff date, the sCR rate favored the DARZALEX-containing arm (63.6 percent vs. 47.4 percent; P=0.0253).1 The CR or better rate continued to favor D-RVd vs. RVd (81.8 percent vs. 60.8 percent; P=0014).1 MRD negativity favored D-RVd vs. RVd (62.5 percent vs. 27.2 percent, P=0.0001). No new safety concerns were observed with D-R maintenance therapy.1 The 24-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 94.5 percent for D-RVd and 90.8 percent for RVd.1 Key Findings from GRIFFIN (Abstract #3243):The poster presentation shared final results of the safety run-in cohort (n=16 patients) from the GRIFFIN study. Theseadditional data showed that maintenance therapy with DARZALEX and lenalidomide (D-R) improved both the sCR rate and MRD negativity rate in patients with NDMMwho underwent D-RVd induction, autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and D-RVd consolidation. This deepening of responses was associated with durable remissions, and no new safety signals were observed with maintenance therapy.2 Initial findings from the safety run-in for GRIFFIN: By the end of post-transplant consolidation, the sCR rate was 56 percent. MRD negativity (10-5) at the end of consolidation was observed in 50 percent of patients, and no patients were MRD negative at 10-6.2 New findings: The sCR rate improved to 94 percent by the end of both 12 and 24 months of D-R maintenance therapy. By the end of 24 months of D-R maintenance therapy, 81 percent of patients were MRD negative at 10-5, with five patients (31 percent) MRD negative at 10-6.2 At a median follow-up of 40.8 months, three of 16 patients had progressed, with estimated 24-month and 36-month PFS rates of 94 percent and 78 percent, respectively.2 With longer follow-up, including two years of D-R maintenance therapy, no new safety concerns were identified.2 ""We continue to be encouraged by the GRIFFIN data showing deeper and improved responses in patients with newly diagnosed, ASCT-eligible multiple myeloma,"" said Andree Amelsberg, M.D., MBA, Vice President, Oncology Medical Affairs, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. ""These data show promising results for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, and we remain committed to exploring the full potential of DARZALEX and DARZALEX FASPRO."" About the GRIFFIN Study4The Phase 2 GRIFFIN (NCT02874742) study has enrolled and treated more than 200 adults ages 18-70 years with NDMM and who are eligible for high-dose therapy/ASCT. In the safety run-in cohort, patients received 25 mg of lenalidomide orally on Days 1-14; 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib subcutaneously on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11; and 20 mg of dexamethasone on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16, every 21 days during the induction and consolidation phases (Cycles 1-6). DARZALEX 16 mg/kg IV was given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycles 1-4 and on Day 1 of Cycles 5-6. During maintenance phase (Cycles 7-32), patients received 10 mg daily of lenalidomide (15 mg beginning at Cycle 10 if tolerated) on Days 1-21 every 28 days and DARZALEX 16 mg/kg IV every 56 days; this was amended to every 28 days based upon emerging clinical pharmacokinetic data demonstrating improved target saturation with every-4-week maintenance dosing. Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide may be continued beyond Cycle 32 in both arms, per local standard of care. In the subsequent randomized Phase 2 portion of the study, approximately 200 patients were randomized and received treatment with RVd, induction and consolidation, ASCT and maintenance therapy with lenalidomide; or DARZALEX and RVd, ASCT and maintenance therapy with DARZALEX and lenalidomide. About DARZALEX Janssen is committed to exploring the potential of DARZALEX (daratumumab) for patients with multiple myeloma across the spectrum of the disease. DARZALEX has been approved in eight indications, three of which are in the frontline setting, including newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible and ineligible. DARZALEX has become a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, having been used in the treatment of more than 150,000 patients worldwide and more than 68,000 patients in the U.S. alone since its U.S. FDA approval in 2015. DARZALEX is the first CD38-directed antibody approved globally to treat multiple myeloma. CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.3 DARZALEX binds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth causing myeloma cell death.4 DARZALEX may also have an effect on normal cells.5 Data across eight Phase 3 clinical trials, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that DARZALEX-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 About Multiple MyelomaMultiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.13,14When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2020, it is estimated that more than 32,000 people will be diagnosed and close to 13,000 will die from the disease in the U.S.15 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.15 DARZALEXINDICATIONS DARZALEX(daratumumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: In combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy In combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant In combination with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant In combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy In combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy In combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor As monotherapy in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent DARZALEXIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS DARZALEX is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-Related Reactions DARZALEX can cause severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination: N=2066), infusion-related reactions occurred in 37% of patients with the Week1 (16mg/kg) infusion, 2% with the Week2 infusion, and cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade3/4 infusion-related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was 1.5hours (range: 0 to 73hours). Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4hours of completing DARZALEX. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema, and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting, and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension. When DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (CASSIOPEIA) for a median of 3.75months (range: 2.4 to 6.9months), upon re-initiation of DARZALEX, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was 11% for the first infusion following ASCT. Infusion-related reactions occurring at re-initiation of DARZALEX following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3 or 4: <1%) with those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. In EQUULEUS, patients receiving combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first 16mg/kg dose at Week 1 split over two days, ie, 8mg/kg on Day1 and Day2, respectively. The incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing infusion-related reactions on Day1 of Week1, 4% on Day2 of Week1, and 8% with subsequent infusions. Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion. To reduce the risk of delayed infusion-related reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interference With Serological Testing Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type is not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX. Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia DARZALEX may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of neutrophils or for recovery of platelets. Interference With Determination of Complete Response Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX and for 3 months after the last dose. The combination of DARZALEX with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence 20%) were: upper respiratory infection, neutropenia, infusionrelated reactions, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, constipation, anemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, cough, pyrexia, dyspnea, and asthenia. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities (40%) with DARZALEX are: neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia. Please click hereto see the full Prescribing Information. DARZALEX FASPRO INDICATIONS DARZALEXFASPRO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed orrefractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who aredouble-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent DARZALEX FASPROIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONS DARZALEX FASPRO(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihi) is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to daratumumab, hyaluronidase or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity and Other Administration Reactions Both systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and local injection-site reactions can occur with DARZALEX FASPRO. Systemic Reactions In a pooled safety population of 490patients who received DARZALEX FASPROas monotherapy or in combination, 11% of patients experienced a systemic administration-related reaction (Grade 2: 3.9%, Grade 3: 1.4%). Systemic administration-related reactions occurred in 10% of patients with the first injection, 0.2% with the second injection, and cumulatively 0.8% with subsequent injections. The median time to onset was 3.7hours (range: 9minutes to 3.5days). Of the 84systemic administration-related reactions that occurred in 52patients, 73(87%) occurred on the day of DARZALEX FASPROadministration. Delayed systemic administration-related reactions have occurred in less than 1% of the patients. Severe reactions included hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension and tachycardia. Other signs and symptoms of systemic administration-related reactions may include respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing, as well as anaphylactic reaction, pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, nausea, and hypotension. Pre-medicate patients with histamine-1 receptor antagonist, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Monitor patients for systemic administration-related reactions, especially following the first and second injections. For anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) administration-related reactions, immediately and permanently discontinue DARZALEX FASPRO.Consider administering corticosteroids and other medications after the administration of DARZALEX FASPROdepending on dosing regimen and medical history to minimize the risk of delayed (defined as occurring the day after administration) systemic administration-related reactions. Local Reactions In this pooled safety population, injection-site reactions occurred in 8% of patients, including Grade2 reactions in 0.6%. The most frequent (>1%) injection-site reaction was injection site erythema. These local reactions occurred a median of 7minutes (range: 0minutes to 4.7days) after starting administration of DARZALEX FASPRO. Monitor for local reactions and consider symptomatic management. NeutropeniaDaratumumab may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPROuntil recovery of neutrophils. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEX FASPROhigher rates of Grade 3-4 neutropenia were observed. ThrombocytopeniaDaratumumab may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPROuntil recovery of platelets. Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX FASPROcan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX FASPROmay cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX FASPROand for 3months after the last dose. The combination of DARZALEX FASPROwith lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy. Interference with Serological TestingDaratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab administration. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX FASPRO.Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX FASPRO. Interference with Determination of Complete Response Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some DARZALEX FASPROtreated patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reaction (20%) with DARZALEX FASPROmonotherapy is: upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse reactions with combination therapy (20% for any combination) include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, insomnia, pyrexia, cough, muscle spasms, back pain, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral sensory neuropathy, constipation, and pneumonia. The most common hematology laboratory abnormalities (40%) with DARZALEX FASPROare decreased leukocytes, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased platelets, and decreased hemoglobin.

In heavily pretreated patients, the overall response rate (ORR) with teclistamab was 73 percent (16/22) at the recommended SC Phase 2 dose (RP2D).1 These results for the SC formulation support the recommended dose for the pivotal Phase 2 registration trial, which has started. In addition, updated results for the intravenous (IV) formulation demonstrate the durability of responses.1 The data presented today for the subcutaneous formulation build on promising results presented earlier this year for the intravenous regimen, said Alfred Garfall, M.D.,* Assistant Professor of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, and presenting author. The preliminary efficacy, including durability of responses, combined with the initial safety profile in this highly pretreated population is encouraging and supports further studies of teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are in need of additional treatment options. The study is conducted in two parts: dose escalation (part 1) and dose expansion (part 2), and enrolled patients with MM who had relapsed or were refractory to established therapies and had previously been treated with a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD).1 Patients had received a median of six prior lines of treatment (range, 2-14); 96 percent were triple-class exposed, 81 percent were triple-class refractory, 91 percent were refractory to the last line of therapy, and 39 percent were penta-drug refractory (to two or more immunomodulatory agents, two or more PIs, and an anti-CD38 therapy).1 Prognosis is poor for patients with refractory MM as treatment options are limited.1 The RP2D was identified as 1500 g/kg SC, and the maximum tolerated dose has not been identified. Fifty-five percent of patients achieved a very good partial response or better (12/22), and 23 percent of patients (5/22) achieved a complete response (CR) or better with RP2D SC dosing.1 After median follow-up of 3.9 months (range of 1.77.4 months), 94 percent (15/16) of responders treated with the SC RP2D were alive and progression-free.1 Responses appeared durable and deepened over time at the RP2D.1 Of the 11 patients who achieved CR and were evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis across all IV and SC doses, eight patients attained MRD-negative CR at a threshold of 10-6 and one at a 10-5 threshold. Sustained MRD-negativity was confirmed for all five evaluable patients across the IV and SC cohorts.1 At the SC RP2D, 64 percent of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events, all of which were Grade 1 or 2 and generally confined to step-up, or a gradual increase in dosing, and first full doses.1 No patients discontinued treatment due to CRS. Of 33 treated patients at the RP2D, only one neurotoxicity event, which was reversible, was observed.1 Selection of the 1500ug/kg SC RP2D is supported by promising safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The SC formulation may provide an opportunity for less frequent dosing for patients than the IV formulation, although this has not been explored in the current study.1 The most common adverse events (AEs) (all grade 20 percent) for the RP2D in the SC cohort were CRS (64 percent); neutropenia (52 percent); anaemia (39 percent); thrombocytopenia (33 percent); leukopenia (33 percent); and fatigue (24 percent).1 In patients who experienced Grade 3 and above AEs (20 percent), the most common at the RP2D SC dose were neutropenia (33 percent); and anaemia (21 percent).1 One Grade 5 treatment related AE (pneumonia) was reported at the 80 g/kg IV dose, but none at the RP2D.1 We are committed to exploring treatment options that use promising modalities in multiple myeloma, including bispecific antibodies like teclistamab, that increase treatment responses through antigen targeting, said Yusri Elsayed, M.D., M.HSc., Ph.D., Vice President, Global Head, Hematologic Malignancies, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Our research in multiple myeloma is broad, exploring multiple targets through a variety of approaches. We continue to identify new treatment options, particularly for patients who have relapsed or become refractory to existing therapies. These initial results demonstrate the early promise of bispecific antibodies for people living with multiple myeloma and may, in the future, provide healthcare professionals with another tool in their arsenal to treat this devastating disease. said Dr Catherine Taylor, Vice President, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. Their development builds on our rich heritage in multiple myeloma, where we have continually sought to investigate new treatment strategies that have the potential to address remaining unmet needs. Additional pharmacokinetic and ex vivo data for teclistamab will be highlighted in a poster on Monday, December 7 from 4:00pm to 12:30am CET (Abstract #3194).2 This study evaluated the ability of teclistamab to induce cytotoxicity and T-cell activation.2 *Alfred Garfall is lead investigator of the NCT03145181 study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About Teclistamab Teclistamab is an investigational bispecific antibody targeting both B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD3. BCMA is expressed at high levels on multiple myeloma cells.3,4,5,6,7 Teclistamab redirects CD3-positive T-cells to BCMA-expressing myeloma cells to induce cytotoxicity of the targeted cells.5,6 Results from preclinical studies demonstrate that teclistamab kills myeloma cell lines and bone marrow-derived myeloma cells from heavily pretreated patients.6 Teclistamab is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (NCT04557098) and is also being explored in combination studies (NCT04586426, NCT04108195). The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.\'s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBodytechnology platform.** InOctober and November 2020, the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), respectively, granted teclistamab orphan designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma.8,9 **DuoBody is a registered trademark of Genmab A/S. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.10 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.11 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,12,13 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.14 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.15 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.16 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.17 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.18 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

CP-195987 December 2020', 'RARITAN, N.J., Dec. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today new data from the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study, which evaluated DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj) as a treatment for patients withlight chain (AL) amyloidosis, a rare disease associated with deterioration of vital organs, most notably the heart, kidneys and liver, for which there are no currently approved therapies.1,2The data, which were featured in an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting, showed a significantly higher complete hematologic response rate with DARZALEX FASPRO treatment in patients with this potentially fatal blood disorder compared to the standard regimen and consistent decreases in markers of disease, indicative of deep hematologic responses(Abstract #552).3 These data supported the recent submissionto theU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval for DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with bortezomib (VELCADE), cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd) for the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis. The submission is being reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review Programto seek the first approval for any drug to treat this disease.4 ""AL amyloidosis is a rare blood disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in the tissues and organs and eventually cause major organ deterioration,"" said study investigator, Raymond L. Comenzo, M.D., Director, John C. Davis Myeloma and Amyloid Program, Tufts Medical Center. ""The data being presented at ASH show the potential of this new treatment regimen. Compared to VCd alone, the D-VCd regimen increased hematologicresponse rates and prolonged major organ deterioration-progression-free survival (MOD-PFS) in patients with AL amyloidosis."" Key Findings from the ANDROMEDA Oral Presentation (Abstract #552): The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study was complete hematologic response rate, classified by the absolute reduction of the involved free light chain (iFLC) and the difference between iFLC and uninvolved free light chain levels.4 The overproduction of light chains by plasma cells leads to the deposit of an abnormal protein called amyloid in major organs, interfering with their function. The data showed that hematologic response rates were higher in patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis who were treated with D-VCd compared to VCd alone (53 percent vs. 18 percent, respectively),3 a current treatment regimen offered to patients with AL amyloidosis. Results consistently favor the daratumumab-containing regimen across various measures of deep hematological response: Hematological response based upon iFLC 20 mg/L (regardless of FLC ratio) favored D-VCd vs. VCd (71 percent vs. 20 percent).3 Hematological response based upon the difference between iFLC and uninvolved FLC (dFLC)<10 mg/L (regardless of FLC ratio) favored D-VCd vs. VCd (64 percent vs. 31 percent).3 Time to MOD-PFS was longer in patients treated with D-VCd who achieved deep hematologic response by all criteria including complete hematological response, low iFLC, and low dFLC.3 Additionally, D-VCd had an acceptable safety profile, consistent with that previously observed for each of the agents alone. ""AL amyloidosis is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat, with symptoms that mimic other conditions. During that delay, major organ deterioration can occur,"" said Jessica Vermeulen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Medical Head/Clinical Leader, Hematology & Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""It is our hope that the ANDROMEDA study contributes to raising awareness of AL amyloidosis among patients and providers, and that approval of DARZALEX FASPRO, pending health authority reviews, will bring a much-needed and effective treatment option to patients."" Extent of cardiac involvement at baseline has a major impact on clinical outcomes for patients with AL amyloidosis.5A separate poster presentation of the ANDROMEDA data focused on the impact of cardiac involvement in newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis patients (Abstract #1392).6Results found that rates of hematologic, cardiac and renal response at six months were higher in the D-VCd group than the VCd group regardless of baseline cardiac stage (I, II or III), with more than 76 percent of these patients having a baseline cardiac stage of II or higher.6Additionally, both MOD-PFS and major organ deterioration-event-free survival(MOD-EFS) favored D-VCd across baseline cardiac stages.6 About the ANDROMEDA Study7ANDROMEDA (NCT03201965) is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, open-label study investigating the safety and efficacy of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd), compared to VCd alone, for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The study includes 388 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with measurable hematologic disease and one or more organs affected. The primary endpoint is overall complete hematologic response rate by intent-to-treat (ITT). Secondary endpoints include MOD-PFS,MOD-EFS, organ response rate, overall survival and time to hematologic response, among others. About DARZALEXFASPROIn August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab. Since launch, it is estimated that more than 150,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.8 DARZALEX FASPROis the only CD38-directed antibody approved to be given subcutaneously to treat patients with multiple myeloma. CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.Daratumumabbinds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth, causing myeloma cell death.9 Daratumumabmay also have an effect on normal cells.10 Data across nine Phase 3 clinical trials in multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that daratumumab-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 Additional studies are underway to assess the efficacy and safety of DARZALEX FASPROin the treatment of other malignant and pre-malignant hematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, including smoldering myeloma and light chain (AL) amyloidosis.19,20 For the full U.S. Prescribing Information, please visitwww.DARZALEX.com. About AL AmyloidosisLight chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare and potentially fatal hematologic disorder that can affect the function of multiple organs. The disease occurs when bone marrow produces abnormal pieces of antibodies called light chains, which clump together to form a substance called amyloid. These clumps of amyloid are deposited in tissues and vital organs and interfere with normal organ function, eventually causing organ deterioration.21,22 It is the most common type of amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis frequently affects the heart, kidneys, digestive tract, liver and nervous system, and is potentially fatal if left untreated.23 Diagnosis is often delayed and prognosis is poor due to advanced, multi-organ, particularly cardiac, involvement.24,25 Each year, an estimated 4,500 people develop AL amyloidosis in the U.S. alone.26 DARZALEX FASPRO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent DARZALEX FASPROTMIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSDARZALEX FASPROTMis contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to daratumumab, hyaluronidase or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity and Other Administration Reactions Both systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and local injection-site reactions can occur with DARZALEX FASPROTM. Systemic Reactions In a pooled safety population of 490patients who received DARZALEX FASPROTMas monotherapy or in combination, 11% of patients experienced a systemic administration-related reaction (Grade 2: 3.9%, Grade 3: 1.4%). Systemic administration-related reactions occurred in 10% of patients with the first injection, 0.2% with the second injection, and cumulatively 0.8% with subsequent injections. The median time to onset was 3.7hours (range: 9minutes to 3.5days). Of the 84systemic administration-related reactions that occurred in 52patients, 73(87%) occurred on the day of DARZALEX FASPROTM administration. Delayed systemic administration-related reactions have occurred in less than 1% of the patients. Severe reactions included hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension and tachycardia. Other signs and symptoms of systemic administration-related reactions may include respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing, as well as anaphylactic reaction, pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, nausea, and hypotension. Pre-medicate patients with histamine-1 receptor antagonist, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Monitor patients for systemic administration-related reactions, especially following the first and second injections. For anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) administration-related reactions, immediately and permanently discontinue DARZALEX FASPROTM. Consider administering corticosteroids and other medications after the administration of DARZALEX FASPROTMdepending on dosing regimen and medical history to minimize the risk of delayed (defined as occurring the day after administration) systemic administration-related reactions. Local Reactions In this pooled safety population, injection-site reactions occurred in 8% of patients, including Grade2 reactions in 0.6%. The most frequent (>1%) injection-site reaction was injection site erythema. These local reactions occurred a median of 7minutes (range: 0minutes to 4.7days) after starting administration of DARZALEX FASPROTM. Monitor for local reactions and consider symptomatic management. NeutropeniaDaratumumab may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPROTMuntil recovery of neutrophils. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEX FASPROTM, higher rates of Grade 3-4 neutropenia were observed. ThrombocytopeniaDaratumumab may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPROTM until recovery of platelets. Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX FASPROTMcan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX FASPROTMmay cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX FASPROTMand for 3months after the last dose. The combination of DARZALEX FASPROTMwith lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy. Interference with Serological TestingDaratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab administration. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX FASPROTM. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX FASPROTM. Interference with Determination of Complete ResponseDaratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some DARZALEX FASPROTM-treated patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reaction (20%) with DARZALEX FASPROTM monotherapy is: upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse reactions with combination therapy(20% for any combination) include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, insomnia, pyrexia,cough, muscle spasms, back pain, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral sensoryneuropathy, constipation, and pneumonia. The most common hematology laboratory abnormalities (40%) with DARZALEX FASPROTM are decreased leukocytes, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased platelets, and decreased hemoglobin.

Nelson will help shape Bigfoots commercialization approach with responsibility for leading the team when they begin to contract with health care providers and payers. Its exciting to transition our energies from FDA submission of our Bigfoot Unity Diabetes Management System to building out key support functions within our organization, said Jeffrey Brewer, CEO of Bigfoot Biomedical. As commercial SVP, Berkley will be instrumental in standing up the commercial operations and driving adoption by providers. He will also craft innovative reimbursement strategies to provide accessibility to the Bigfoot Unity solution to the millions of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who struggle with the constant decision-making around insulin dosing. In building out Bigfoots commercial team, Nelson announced the addition of Tony Galliani as vice president of sales and Sam Auderer as director of commercial operations. The Bigfoot team has done an incredible job with a tremendous amount of fresh thinking to get the product to this point, said Nelson. Now Ive embraced the challenge of designing the commercial model that will put the Bigfoot Unity program into the hands of the people who need it. There are many innovations coming out for insulin pump users but few for people who are under Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) therapy, so were excited to deliver a solution for this underserved market. At a startup you often get the opportunity to break the norms, which is exactly what Bigfoot aims to do. Together, Nelson and his new team represent a wealth of experience and knowledge in the medical device space and operationalizing a provider reimbursement and services model. Nelson and Auderer come to Bigfoot Biomedical having both previously worked for Voluntis where Nelson was chief growth officer and Auderer was director of commercial operations, and United Allergy Services where Nelson served as vice president of business development and payer relations. Nelson also brings experience from Medtronic and Siemens Health. Galliani comes to Bigfoot Biomedical with more than two decades in the diabetes device industry. Most recently, he was vice president of sales for Companion Medical, successfully helping build their commercial team and launching their initial product. Prior to his work for Companion, Galliani worked for Tandem Diabetes Care and spent more than a decade with Animas, a Johnson & Johnson company. Galliani will focus his work at Bigfoot Biomedical on health care provider sales. Not only does Tony bring to Bigfoot a wealth of sales experience but his leadership on key innovations such as the smart pen are known throughout the industry, said Brewer. Having the experience and expertise of Berkley, Tony and Sam at the helm of our commercial operations gives Bigfoot a huge advantage as we build relationships with both providers and payers. Bigfoot has been extremely intentional in regard to its approach to Bigfoot Unity, which makes the work of our commercial team especially exciting, said Nelson. The current gaps in advances for MDI therapy, the simplicity of our solution and the telemedicine implications of access to rich physiologic data opens the door to supporting better overall health outcomes, which is a key motivator for both providers and payers. Bigfoot Unity is a real-time, dose-decision support system utilizing proprietary smart pen caps and integrating Abbotts new FreeStyle Libre 2 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) platform. At mealtime or other occasions when the person with diabetes needs insulin, the Bigfoot Unity pen cap interfaces with the CGM sensor to display the appropriate insulin dose based on their physicians recommendations. Data from the Bigfoot Unity program will be easily available for users to share with their health care providers in person or via telemedicine. Easy access to the users data is designed to support their health care providers in making treatment adjustments with the goal of improving A1C levels. Fundamentally what we are doing is helping people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have confidence and the information they need to make the right dosing decisions, said Brewer. We want them to succeed in MDI therapy, and we believe the best way to achieve this is by making it as simple and seamless as possible. About Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. Bigfoot Biomedical was founded by a team of people with personal connections to type 1 and type 2 diabetes and, with its Bigfoot Unity and Bigfoot Autonomy programs, seeks to change the paradigm of care for insulin-requiring diabetes by leveraging data, connectivity, telemedicine, automation and machine learning to reduce the burden on people with insulin-requiring diabetes and maximize the leverage of health care providers.

Media Contact Marisa Garcia de Celis, [emailprotected] SOURCE We Are All Human', 'HORSHAM, Pa., Dec. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced new data from the randomized Phase 2 GRIFFIN study showing that the addition of DARZALEX (daratumumab) to lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (VELCADE) and dexamethasone (D-RVd), followed by DARZALEXplus lenalidomide (D-R) maintenance therapy, resulted in deeper and improved responses, including minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, compared to RVd followed by R alone in newly diagnosed, stem cell transplant-eligible patients with multiple myeloma.1These data investigating the use of DARZALEX in combination with RVd, which were shared in separate oral and poster presentations at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting, provide further evidence that this regimen may provide greater efficacy for transplant-eligible, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma(NDMM) than standard therapy. The oral presentation (Abstract #549) shared longer-term follow-up data, and the poster presentation (Abstract #3243) featured additional data from the safety run-in cohort.1,2 ""The long-term GRIFFIN data show that maintenance therapy with DARZALEX in combination with lenalidomide (D-R) resulted in deeper responses compared to R alone in patients with multiple myeloma who are newly diagnosed and transplant-eligible,"" said Peter Voorhees, M.D., Atrium Health\'s Levine Cancer Institute and GRIFFIN study investigator. ""These data indicate that the addition of DARZALEX to RVd followed by R maintenance results in improved response rates and depth of response during induction, consolidation and maintenance treatment cycles."" Key Findings from GRIFFIN (Abstract #549):The GRIFFIN oral presentation featured updated safety and efficacy data based onlonger follow-up for D-RVd and evaluated the potential role of D-R for maintenance therapy in patients with NDMM.1 Initial findings of GRIFFIN: At the end of post-transplant consolidation (median follow-up, 13.5 months) in the response-evaluable population, the stringent complete response (sCR) rate favored D-RVd vs. RVd (42.4 percent vs. 32.0 percent; P=0.0253).1 The complete response (CR) or better rate also favored D-RVd vs. RVd (51.5 percent vs. 42.3 percent; P=0.0014).1 With an additional 12 months of D-R or R maintenance therapy (median follow-up of 27.4 months), responses continued to deepen and remained higher for the DARZALEX-containing arm:1 At the clinical cutoff date, the sCR rate favored the DARZALEX-containing arm (63.6 percent vs. 47.4 percent; P=0.0253).1 The CR or better rate continued to favor D-RVd vs. RVd (81.8 percent vs. 60.8 percent; P=0014).1 MRD negativity favored D-RVd vs. RVd (62.5 percent vs. 27.2 percent, P=0.0001). No new safety concerns were observed with D-R maintenance therapy.1 The 24-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 94.5 percent for D-RVd and 90.8 percent for RVd.1 Key Findings from GRIFFIN (Abstract #3243):The poster presentation shared final results of the safety run-in cohort (n=16 patients) from the GRIFFIN study. Theseadditional data showed that maintenance therapy with DARZALEX and lenalidomide (D-R) improved both the sCR rate and MRD negativity rate in patients with NDMMwho underwent D-RVd induction, autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and D-RVd consolidation. This deepening of responses was associated with durable remissions, and no new safety signals were observed with maintenance therapy.2 Initial findings from the safety run-in for GRIFFIN: By the end of post-transplant consolidation, the sCR rate was 56 percent. MRD negativity (10-5) at the end of consolidation was observed in 50 percent of patients, and no patients were MRD negative at 10-6.2 New findings: The sCR rate improved to 94 percent by the end of both 12 and 24 months of D-R maintenance therapy. By the end of 24 months of D-R maintenance therapy, 81 percent of patients were MRD negative at 10-5, with five patients (31 percent) MRD negative at 10-6.2 At a median follow-up of 40.8 months, three of 16 patients had progressed, with estimated 24-month and 36-month PFS rates of 94 percent and 78 percent, respectively.2 With longer follow-up, including two years of D-R maintenance therapy, no new safety concerns were identified.2 ""We continue to be encouraged by the GRIFFIN data showing deeper and improved responses in patients with newly diagnosed, ASCT-eligible multiple myeloma,"" said Andree Amelsberg, M.D., MBA, Vice President, Oncology Medical Affairs, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. ""These data show promising results for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, and we remain committed to exploring the full potential of DARZALEX and DARZALEX FASPRO."" About the GRIFFIN Study4The Phase 2 GRIFFIN (NCT02874742) study has enrolled and treated more than 200 adults ages 18-70 years with NDMM and who are eligible for high-dose therapy/ASCT. In the safety run-in cohort, patients received 25 mg of lenalidomide orally on Days 1-14; 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib subcutaneously on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11; and 20 mg of dexamethasone on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16, every 21 days during the induction and consolidation phases (Cycles 1-6). DARZALEX 16 mg/kg IV was given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycles 1-4 and on Day 1 of Cycles 5-6. During maintenance phase (Cycles 7-32), patients received 10 mg daily of lenalidomide (15 mg beginning at Cycle 10 if tolerated) on Days 1-21 every 28 days and DARZALEX 16 mg/kg IV every 56 days; this was amended to every 28 days based upon emerging clinical pharmacokinetic data demonstrating improved target saturation with every-4-week maintenance dosing. Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide may be continued beyond Cycle 32 in both arms, per local standard of care. In the subsequent randomized Phase 2 portion of the study, approximately 200 patients were randomized and received treatment with RVd, induction and consolidation, ASCT and maintenance therapy with lenalidomide; or DARZALEX and RVd, ASCT and maintenance therapy with DARZALEX and lenalidomide. About DARZALEX Janssen is committed to exploring the potential of DARZALEX (daratumumab) for patients with multiple myeloma across the spectrum of the disease. DARZALEX has been approved in eight indications, three of which are in the frontline setting, including newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible and ineligible. DARZALEX has become a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, having been used in the treatment of more than 150,000 patients worldwide and more than 68,000 patients in the U.S. alone since its U.S. FDA approval in 2015. DARZALEX is the first CD38-directed antibody approved globally to treat multiple myeloma. CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.3 DARZALEX binds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth causing myeloma cell death.4 DARZALEX may also have an effect on normal cells.5 Data across eight Phase 3 clinical trials, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that DARZALEX-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 About Multiple MyelomaMultiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.13,14When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2020, it is estimated that more than 32,000 people will be diagnosed and close to 13,000 will die from the disease in the U.S.15 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.15 DARZALEXINDICATIONS DARZALEX(daratumumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: In combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy In combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant In combination with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant In combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy In combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy In combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor As monotherapy in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent DARZALEXIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS DARZALEX is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-Related Reactions DARZALEX can cause severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination: N=2066), infusion-related reactions occurred in 37% of patients with the Week1 (16mg/kg) infusion, 2% with the Week2 infusion, and cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade3/4 infusion-related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was 1.5hours (range: 0 to 73hours). Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4hours of completing DARZALEX. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema, and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting, and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension. When DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (CASSIOPEIA) for a median of 3.75months (range: 2.4 to 6.9months), upon re-initiation of DARZALEX, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was 11% for the first infusion following ASCT. Infusion-related reactions occurring at re-initiation of DARZALEX following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3 or 4: <1%) with those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. In EQUULEUS, patients receiving combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first 16mg/kg dose at Week 1 split over two days, ie, 8mg/kg on Day1 and Day2, respectively. The incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing infusion-related reactions on Day1 of Week1, 4% on Day2 of Week1, and 8% with subsequent infusions. Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion. To reduce the risk of delayed infusion-related reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interference With Serological Testing Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type is not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX. Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia DARZALEX may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of neutrophils or for recovery of platelets. Interference With Determination of Complete Response Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX and for 3 months after the last dose. The combination of DARZALEX with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence 20%) were: upper respiratory infection, neutropenia, infusionrelated reactions, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, constipation, anemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, cough, pyrexia, dyspnea, and asthenia. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities (40%) with DARZALEX are: neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia.

DARZALEX FASPRO INDICATIONS DARZALEXFASPRO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed orrefractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who aredouble-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent DARZALEX FASPROIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONS DARZALEX FASPRO(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihi) is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to daratumumab, hyaluronidase or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity and Other Administration Reactions Both systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and local injection-site reactions can occur with DARZALEX FASPRO. Systemic Reactions In a pooled safety population of 490patients who received DARZALEX FASPROas monotherapy or in combination, 11% of patients experienced a systemic administration-related reaction (Grade 2: 3.9%, Grade 3: 1.4%). Systemic administration-related reactions occurred in 10% of patients with the first injection, 0.2% with the second injection, and cumulatively 0.8% with subsequent injections. The median time to onset was 3.7hours (range: 9minutes to 3.5days). Of the 84systemic administration-related reactions that occurred in 52patients, 73(87%) occurred on the day of DARZALEX FASPROadministration. Delayed systemic administration-related reactions have occurred in less than 1% of the patients. Severe reactions included hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension and tachycardia. Other signs and symptoms of systemic administration-related reactions may include respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing, as well as anaphylactic reaction, pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, nausea, and hypotension. Pre-medicate patients with histamine-1 receptor antagonist, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Monitor patients for systemic administration-related reactions, especially following the first and second injections. For anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) administration-related reactions, immediately and permanently discontinue DARZALEX FASPRO.Consider administering corticosteroids and other medications after the administration of DARZALEX FASPROdepending on dosing regimen and medical history to minimize the risk of delayed (defined as occurring the day after administration) systemic administration-related reactions. Local Reactions In this pooled safety population, injection-site reactions occurred in 8% of patients, including Grade2 reactions in 0.6%. The most frequent (>1%) injection-site reaction was injection site erythema. These local reactions occurred a median of 7minutes (range: 0minutes to 4.7days) after starting administration of DARZALEX FASPRO. Monitor for local reactions and consider symptomatic management. NeutropeniaDaratumumab may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPROuntil recovery of neutrophils. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEX FASPROhigher rates of Grade 3-4 neutropenia were observed. ThrombocytopeniaDaratumumab may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPROuntil recovery of platelets. Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX FASPROcan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX FASPROmay cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX FASPROand for 3months after the last dose.

This factor has increased the research and development activities in psychedelic drugs across the U.S. Hence, this factor has led various pharmaceutical and therapeutic manufactures to shift towards psychedelic drugs. This has further resulted into continuous focus of psychedelic drugs improvement and reduction of side effects associated with psychedelic drugs. Due to these factors, the market is expected to grow at the significant growth rate in the forecast period of 2020 to 2027."" Mind Cure Health Inc. (CSE: MCUR.CNQ) (OTCQB: MCURF) BREAKING NEWS: WSGF Mind Cure Announces its Research Program with Psychedelic Compounds - Mind Cure Health Incis pleased today to announce its translational research program, with an initial focus on psilocybin, ketamine and ibogaine. These three psychedelic compounds have demonstrated safety profiles with proven efficacy but have not been optimized for medical use. This research program will enable Mind Cure to investigate these compounds for use in pharmaceuticals that treat physical and psychological pain and related mental health illnesses. Translational research is multidisciplinary in nature and involves applying laboratory research and preclinical studies to develop clinical trials and studies in humans, with the long-term aim of moving scientific discoveries quicker and more effectively. With this announcement, Mind Cure begins executing on its groundbreaking approach to expedite research and development programs in psychedelic compounds and methodologies. Mind Cure is focused on delivering validation of commercially viable medicines, methods and tools to address the numerous priorities in treating mental health and building upon the current landscape of research in psychedelic compounds, which have largely been studied for psychiatric medicine to date. Mind Cure\'s research into pain will holistically account for the mixed effects of physical pain, psychological pain and the referred and lasting effects on quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients. ""Pain transcends all health conditions and, in many ways, contributes significantly to secondary complications, some of which continue throughout a person\'s lifetime,"" stated Dr. Ryan Hartwell. ""Despite social stigmas, many classical psychedelics have safely demonstrated profound therapeutic effectiveness with alleviating all forms of pain associated with neurological trauma and chronic diseases. We begin our research with tremendous promise for new medicines that share structural similarities with improved receptor targeting, dosing, and therapeutic profiles."" Currently, a variety of drugs are used to manage pain, resulting from inflammation in response to tissue damage, chemical agents/pathogens (nociceptive pain) or nerve damage (neuropathic pain). Most of these drugs act by binding to protein targets on cell membranes and affecting biochemical processes of the body. The need for better drugs to treat all types of pain is only increasing. One specific area of pain treatment Mind Cure is pursuing is headaches. The global migraine drug market is expected to reach USD 3.51 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 13.3% from the 2018 data. Psychoactive properties of ibogaine have been known for decades, and more recently, experimental data from animals and anecdotal reports in humans has shown ibogaine to possess anti-addictive effects. ""Ibogaine has tremendous potential,"" said Hamilton Morris, who serves on Mind Cure\'s scientific advisory board. ""It has an incredibly complex pharmacology and that\'s just what is currently known, there is still a great deal of research to be done with ibogaine and as well as related alkaloids and synthetic derivatives."" With respect to ketamine, it has become one of the most promising and exciting neuroprotective agents and therapeutic medicines following neurological and cerebral trauma, and psychiatric conditions such as depression and PTSD. Both ketamine and ibogaine are listed in Canada on the Prescription Drug List and can be administered with a prescription. Recently, psilocybin cubensis has received exemption for medical use. ""We have built a world-class team of scientific minds, and one with a remarkable multi-disciplinary approach to treating mental health,"" stated Mind Cure President and CEO Kelsey Ramsden. ""Under the leadership of Dr. Hartwell, research using these first three psychedelic compounds is just the beginning. Our focus is on bringingtreatmentto market with speed andrigor, as such these compoundsmake the utmost strategic and tactical sensedue to their proven efficacy and alignment with the areas of mental health that we are focused on.""

Contact Information:email:[emailprotected]+1(561)325-8757 SOURCE FinancialNewsMedia.com', 'RARITAN, N.J., Dec. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today new data from the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study, which evaluated DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj) as a treatment for patients withlight chain (AL) amyloidosis, a rare disease associated with deterioration of vital organs, most notably the heart, kidneys and liver, for which there are no currently approved therapies.1,2The data, which were featured in an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting, showed a significantly higher complete hematologic response rate with DARZALEX FASPRO treatment in patients with this potentially fatal blood disorder compared to the standard regimen and consistent decreases in markers of disease, indicative of deep hematologic responses(Abstract #552).3 These data supported the recent submissionto theU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval for DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with bortezomib (VELCADE), cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd) for the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis. The submission is being reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review Programto seek the first approval for any drug to treat this disease.4 ""AL amyloidosis is a rare blood disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in the tissues and organs and eventually cause major organ deterioration,"" said study investigator, Raymond L. Comenzo, M.D., Director, John C. Davis Myeloma and Amyloid Program, Tufts Medical Center. ""The data being presented at ASH show the potential of this new treatment regimen. Compared to VCd alone, the D-VCd regimen increased hematologicresponse rates and prolonged major organ deterioration-progression-free survival (MOD-PFS) in patients with AL amyloidosis."" Key Findings from the ANDROMEDA Oral Presentation (Abstract #552): The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study was complete hematologic response rate, classified by the absolute reduction of the involved free light chain (iFLC) and the difference between iFLC and uninvolved free light chain levels.4 The overproduction of light chains by plasma cells leads to the deposit of an abnormal protein called amyloid in major organs, interfering with their function. The data showed that hematologic response rates were higher in patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis who were treated with D-VCd compared to VCd alone (53 percent vs. 18 percent, respectively),3 a current treatment regimen offered to patients with AL amyloidosis. Results consistently favor the daratumumab-containing regimen across various measures of deep hematological response: Hematological response based upon iFLC 20 mg/L (regardless of FLC ratio) favored D-VCd vs. VCd (71 percent vs. 20 percent).3 Hematological response based upon the difference between iFLC and uninvolved FLC (dFLC)<10 mg/L (regardless of FLC ratio) favored D-VCd vs. VCd (64 percent vs. 31 percent).3 Time to MOD-PFS was longer in patients treated with D-VCd who achieved deep hematologic response by all criteria including complete hematological response, low iFLC, and low dFLC.3 Additionally, D-VCd had an acceptable safety profile, consistent with that previously observed for each of the agents alone. ""AL amyloidosis is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat, with symptoms that mimic other conditions. During that delay, major organ deterioration can occur,"" said Jessica Vermeulen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Medical Head/Clinical Leader, Hematology & Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""It is our hope that the ANDROMEDA study contributes to raising awareness of AL amyloidosis among patients and providers, and that approval of DARZALEX FASPRO, pending health authority reviews, will bring a much-needed and effective treatment option to patients."" Extent of cardiac involvement at baseline has a major impact on clinical outcomes for patients with AL amyloidosis.5A separate poster presentation of the ANDROMEDA data focused on the impact of cardiac involvement in newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis patients (Abstract #1392).6Results found that rates of hematologic, cardiac and renal response at six months were higher in the D-VCd group than the VCd group regardless of baseline cardiac stage (I, II or III), with more than 76 percent of these patients having a baseline cardiac stage of II or higher.6Additionally, both MOD-PFS and major organ deterioration-event-free survival(MOD-EFS) favored D-VCd across baseline cardiac stages.6 About the ANDROMEDA Study7ANDROMEDA (NCT03201965) is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, open-label study investigating the safety and efficacy of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd), compared to VCd alone, for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The study includes 388 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with measurable hematologic disease and one or more organs affected. The primary endpoint is overall complete hematologic response rate by intent-to-treat (ITT). Secondary endpoints include MOD-PFS,MOD-EFS, organ response rate, overall survival and time to hematologic response, among others. About DARZALEXFASPROIn August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab. Since launch, it is estimated that more than 150,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.8 DARZALEX FASPROis the only CD38-directed antibody approved to be given subcutaneously to treat patients with multiple myeloma. CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.Daratumumabbinds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth, causing myeloma cell death.9 Daratumumabmay also have an effect on normal cells.10 Data across nine Phase 3 clinical trials in multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that daratumumab-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 Additional studies are underway to assess the efficacy and safety of DARZALEX FASPROin the treatment of other malignant and pre-malignant hematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, including smoldering myeloma and light chain (AL) amyloidosis.19,20 For the full U.S. Prescribing Information, please visitwww.DARZALEX.com. About AL AmyloidosisLight chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare and potentially fatal hematologic disorder that can affect the function of multiple organs. The disease occurs when bone marrow produces abnormal pieces of antibodies called light chains, which clump together to form a substance called amyloid. These clumps of amyloid are deposited in tissues and vital organs and interfere with normal organ function, eventually causing organ deterioration.21,22 It is the most common type of amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis frequently affects the heart, kidneys, digestive tract, liver and nervous system, and is potentially fatal if left untreated.23 Diagnosis is often delayed and prognosis is poor due to advanced, multi-organ, particularly cardiac, involvement.24,25 Each year, an estimated 4,500 people develop AL amyloidosis in the U.S. alone.26 DARZALEX FASPRO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma: in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent DARZALEX FASPROTMIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSDARZALEX FASPROTMis contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to daratumumab, hyaluronidase or any of the components of the formulation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity and Other Administration Reactions Both systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and local injection-site reactions can occur with DARZALEX FASPROTM. Systemic Reactions In a pooled safety population of 490patients who received DARZALEX FASPROTMas monotherapy or in combination, 11% of patients experienced a systemic administration-related reaction (Grade 2: 3.9%, Grade 3: 1.4%). Systemic administration-related reactions occurred in 10% of patients with the first injection, 0.2% with the second injection, and cumulatively 0.8% with subsequent injections. The median time to onset was 3.7hours (range: 9minutes to 3.5days). Of the 84systemic administration-related reactions that occurred in 52patients, 73(87%) occurred on the day of DARZALEX FASPROTM administration. Delayed systemic administration-related reactions have occurred in less than 1% of the patients. Severe reactions included hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension and tachycardia. Other signs and symptoms of systemic administration-related reactions may include respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing, as well as anaphylactic reaction, pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, nausea, and hypotension. Pre-medicate patients with histamine-1 receptor antagonist, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Monitor patients for systemic administration-related reactions, especially following the first and second injections. For anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) administration-related reactions, immediately and permanently discontinue DARZALEX FASPROTM. Consider administering corticosteroids and other medications after the administration of DARZALEX FASPROTMdepending on dosing regimen and medical history to minimize the risk of delayed (defined as occurring the day after administration) systemic administration-related reactions. Local Reactions In this pooled safety population, injection-site reactions occurred in 8% of patients, including Grade2 reactions in 0.6%. The most frequent (>1%) injection-site reaction was injection site erythema. These local reactions occurred a median of 7minutes (range: 0minutes to 4.7days) after starting administration of DARZALEX FASPROTM. Monitor for local reactions and consider symptomatic management. NeutropeniaDaratumumab may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPROTMuntil recovery of neutrophils. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEX FASPROTM, higher rates of Grade 3-4 neutropenia were observed. ThrombocytopeniaDaratumumab may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer\'s prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPROTM until recovery of platelets. Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX FASPROTMcan cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX FASPROTMmay cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX FASPROTMand for 3months after the last dose. The combination of DARZALEX FASPROTMwith lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy. Interference with Serological TestingDaratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6months after the last daratumumab administration. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient\'s serum. The determination of a patient\'s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX FASPROTM. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX FASPROTM. Interference with Determination of Complete ResponseDaratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some DARZALEX FASPROTM-treated patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reaction (20%) with DARZALEX FASPROTM monotherapy is: upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse reactions with combination therapy(20% for any combination) include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, insomnia, pyrexia,cough, muscle spasms, back pain, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral sensoryneuropathy, constipation, and pneumonia. The most common hematology laboratory abnormalities (40%) with DARZALEX FASPROTM are decreased leukocytes, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased platelets, and decreased hemoglobin.

Nelson will help shape Bigfoots commercialization approach with responsibility for leading the team when they begin to contract with health care providers and payers. Its exciting to transition our energies from FDA submission of our Bigfoot Unity Diabetes Management System to building out key support functions within our organization, said Jeffrey Brewer, CEO of Bigfoot Biomedical. As commercial SVP, Berkley will be instrumental in standing up the commercial operations and driving adoption by providers. He will also craft innovative reimbursement strategies to provide accessibility to the Bigfoot Unity solution to the millions of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who struggle with the constant decision-making around insulin dosing. In building out Bigfoots commercial team, Nelson announced the addition of Tony Galliani as vice president of sales and Sam Auderer as director of commercial operations. The Bigfoot team has done an incredible job with a tremendous amount of fresh thinking to get the product to this point, said Nelson. Now Ive embraced the challenge of designing the commercial model that will put the Bigfoot Unity program into the hands of the people who need it. There are many innovations coming out for insulin pump users but few for people who are under Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) therapy, so were excited to deliver a solution for this underserved market. At a startup you often get the opportunity to break the norms, which is exactly what Bigfoot aims to do. Together, Nelson and his new team represent a wealth of experience and knowledge in the medical device space and operationalizing a provider reimbursement and services model. Nelson and Auderer come to Bigfoot Biomedical having both previously worked for Voluntis where Nelson was chief growth officer and Auderer was director of commercial operations, and United Allergy Services where Nelson served as vice president of business development and payer relations. Nelson also brings experience from Medtronic and Siemens Health. Galliani comes to Bigfoot Biomedical with more than two decades in the diabetes device industry. Most recently, he was vice president of sales for Companion Medical, successfully helping build their commercial team and launching their initial product. Prior to his work for Companion, Galliani worked for Tandem Diabetes Care and spent more than a decade with Animas, a Johnson & Johnson company. Galliani will focus his work at Bigfoot Biomedical on health care provider sales. Not only does Tony bring to Bigfoot a wealth of sales experience but his leadership on key innovations such as the smart pen are known throughout the industry, said Brewer. Having the experience and expertise of Berkley, Tony and Sam at the helm of our commercial operations gives Bigfoot a huge advantage as we build relationships with both providers and payers. Bigfoot has been extremely intentional in regard to its approach to Bigfoot Unity, which makes the work of our commercial team especially exciting, said Nelson. The current gaps in advances for MDI therapy, the simplicity of our solution and the telemedicine implications of access to rich physiologic data opens the door to supporting better overall health outcomes, which is a key motivator for both providers and payers. Bigfoot Unity is a real-time, dose-decision support system utilizing proprietary smart pen caps and integrating Abbotts new FreeStyle Libre 2 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) platform. At mealtime or other occasions when the person with diabetes needs insulin, the Bigfoot Unity pen cap interfaces with the CGM sensor to display the appropriate insulin dose based on their physicians recommendations. Data from the Bigfoot Unity program will be easily available for users to share with their health care providers in person or via telemedicine. Easy access to the users data is designed to support their health care providers in making treatment adjustments with the goal of improving A1C levels. Fundamentally what we are doing is helping people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have confidence and the information they need to make the right dosing decisions, said Brewer. We want them to succeed in MDI therapy, and we believe the best way to achieve this is by making it as simple and seamless as possible. About Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc.

Nelson will help shape Bigfoots commercialization approach with responsibility for leading the team when they begin to contract with health care providers and payers. Its exciting to transition our energies from FDA submission of our Bigfoot Unity Diabetes Management System to building out key support functions within our organization, said Jeffrey Brewer, CEO of Bigfoot Biomedical. As commercial SVP, Berkley will be instrumental in standing up the commercial operations and driving adoption by providers. He will also craft innovative reimbursement strategies to provide accessibility to the Bigfoot Unity solution to the millions of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who struggle with the constant decision-making around insulin dosing. In building out Bigfoots commercial team, Nelson announced the addition of Tony Galliani as vice president of sales and Sam Auderer as director of commercial operations. The Bigfoot team has done an incredible job with a tremendous amount of fresh thinking to get the product to this point, said Nelson. Now Ive embraced the challenge of designing the commercial model that will put the Bigfoot Unity program into the hands of the people who need it. There are many innovations coming out for insulin pump users but few for people who are under Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) therapy, so were excited to deliver a solution for this underserved market. At a startup you often get the opportunity to break the norms, which is exactly what Bigfoot aims to do. Together, Nelson and his new team represent a wealth of experience and knowledge in the medical device space and operationalizing a provider reimbursement and services model. Nelson and Auderer come to Bigfoot Biomedical having both previously worked for Voluntis where Nelson was chief growth officer and Auderer was director of commercial operations, and United Allergy Services where Nelson served as vice president of business development and payer relations. Nelson also brings experience from Medtronic and Siemens Health. Galliani comes to Bigfoot Biomedical with more than two decades in the diabetes device industry. Most recently, he was vice president of sales for Companion Medical, successfully helping build their commercial team and launching their initial product. Prior to his work for Companion, Galliani worked for Tandem Diabetes Care and spent more than a decade with Animas, a Johnson & Johnson company. Galliani will focus his work at Bigfoot Biomedical on health care provider sales. Not only does Tony bring to Bigfoot a wealth of sales experience but his leadership on key innovations such as the smart pen are known throughout the industry, said Brewer. Having the experience and expertise of Berkley, Tony and Sam at the helm of our commercial operations gives Bigfoot a huge advantage as we build relationships with both providers and payers. Bigfoot has been extremely intentional in regard to its approach to Bigfoot Unity, which makes the work of our commercial team especially exciting, said Nelson. The current gaps in advances for MDI therapy, the simplicity of our solution and the telemedicine implications of access to rich physiologic data opens the door to supporting better overall health outcomes, which is a key motivator for both providers and payers. Bigfoot Unity is a real-time, dose-decision support system utilizing proprietary smart pen caps and integrating Abbotts new FreeStyle Libre 2 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) platform. At mealtime or other occasions when the person with diabetes needs insulin, the Bigfoot Unity pen cap interfaces with the CGM sensor to display the appropriate insulin dose based on their physicians recommendations. Data from the Bigfoot Unity program will be easily available for users to share with their health care providers in person or via telemedicine. Easy access to the users data is designed to support their health care providers in making treatment adjustments with the goal of improving A1C levels. Fundamentally what we are doing is helping people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have confidence and the information they need to make the right dosing decisions, said Brewer. We want them to succeed in MDI therapy, and we believe the best way to achieve this is by making it as simple and seamless as possible. About Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. Bigfoot Biomedical was founded by a team of people with personal connections to type 1 and type 2 diabetes and, with its Bigfoot Unity and Bigfoot Autonomy programs, seeks to change the paradigm of care for insulin-requiring diabetes by leveraging data, connectivity, telemedicine, automation and machine learning to reduce the burden on people with insulin-requiring diabetes and maximize the leverage of health care providers.

There were no mortalities and no test item-related changes in clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, or other systemic nor macroscopic adverse effects at doses up to 15 mg/day (highest dose level tested). The study provided necessary and reassuring safety data to move PrEP-001 into longer duration dosing in clinical studies. The company intends to move forward with areal-world, field trial intended to validate the efficacy of its PrEP-001 against all circulating respiratory viruses (including COVID-19, influenza and the common cold). Founded in 2015 as a spinout from Johnson & Johnson, PrEP Biopharm Limited has conducted pre-clinical and proof of concept clinical studies that have shown positive efficacy in humans. The proof of concept challenge studies involving short duration dosing in human subjects demonstrated positive safety and efficacy results specifically for influenza and rhinovirus (the most common viral infectious agent in humans that is the predominant cause of the common cold). In other animal model challenge studies, positive data was shown for SARS, MERS, RSV and a variety of other respiratory viruses that cannot ethically be assessed in human challenge studies. PrEP-001 (Poly I:C) is neither a vaccine nor an antiviral. Rather, it is a synthetic RNA \'viral mimic\' that stimulates the body\'s pan-viral innate immune response locally in the upper respiratory tract. Administered via a once daily nasal spray it leverages the innate immune system to create an antiviral environment to stop invading respiratory viruses. As such, it is possible that PrEP-001 could be used as a stand-alone pan-viral prophylaxis or as an adjuvant for live and inactivated or peptide intranasal vaccines targeting specific respiratory viruses. Previous studies in animals have demonstrated that intranasal administration of poly IC shortly after vaccination with live-attenuated, inactivated and haemagglutinin antigen preparations of influenza virus enhanced respiratory dendritic cell function, CD8 T cell formation, and production of neutralizing antibodies. The proposed field trial will provide real world data as a stand-alone prophylaxis against influenza, the common cold, COVID-19 and other respiratory viral illnesses. ""We are excited about these new data allowing us to dose PrEP-001 daily for up to 12 weeks which is the expected length of a typical cold & flu season. We intend to move forward with a field trial to assess the efficacy against a number of common respiratory viruses and provide real world validation of PrEP-001 as a novel pan-viral prophylaxis,"" said Ryan Muldoon, CEO of PrEP Biopharm Limited. The influenza and rhinovirus market opportunities alone are enormous. But PrEP-001 could also play a meaningful role in the current COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics with other novel respiratory viruses.

The incipience of cosmeceuticals has revolutionized the cosmetic and personal care industry. These products, unlike the makeup products, can determine the origin of the defects rather than just treating them. In addition, the rising desire of people to maintain healthy skin without using chemicals is adding fuel to the market growth. Moreover, the increasing urban population coupled with rising consumer awareness related to the benefits of cosmeceuticals is contributing to market growth. Besides, the application of advanced technologies such as plant stem cell technology, and nanotechnology for the advancement of new active ingredients also foster the growth of the global cosmeceuticals market.Furthermore, it has been remarked that the demand is huge among the people of age group 30-45. Over the past few years, the decreasing mortality rate has given rise to the aging population across the globe. People living longer and requiring maintaining their young appearance is absolutely influencing market growth globally. The need for anti-aging products to limit hair damage, age spots, uneven skin tone, dry skin, and wrinkles is on the climb. This, in turn, has produced opportunities for new elements and variations in the cosmetic industry, thus addressing the manufacturer\'s concentration on active anti-aging based skin products.The major players in the market are Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Sabinsa Corporation, L\'Oral, Allergan, AVON, Estee Lauder, Unilever, Beiersdorf, and Croda International Plc.Verified Market Research has segmented the Global Cosmeceuticals Market On the basis of Product, Distribution Channel, and Geography.

There were no mortalities and no test item-related changes in clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, or other systemic nor macroscopic adverse effects at doses up to 15 mg/day (highest dose level tested). The study provided necessary and reassuring safety data to move PrEP-001 into longer duration dosing in clinical studies. The company intends to move forward with areal-world, field trial intended to validate the efficacy of its PrEP-001 against all circulating respiratory viruses (including COVID-19, influenza and the common cold). Founded in 2015 as a spinout from Johnson & Johnson, PrEP Biopharm Limited has conducted pre-clinical and proof of concept clinical studies that have shown positive efficacy in humans. The proof of concept challenge studies involving short duration dosing in human subjects demonstrated positive safety and efficacy results specifically for influenza and rhinovirus (the most common viral infectious agent in humans that is the predominant cause of the common cold). In other animal model challenge studies, positive data was shown for SARS, MERS, RSV and a variety of other respiratory viruses that cannot ethically be assessed in human challenge studies. PrEP-001 (Poly I:C) is neither a vaccine nor an antiviral. Rather, it is a synthetic RNA \'viral mimic\' that stimulates the body\'s pan-viral innate immune response locally in the upper respiratory tract. Administered via a once daily nasal spray it leverages the innate immune system to create an antiviral environment to stop invading respiratory viruses. As such, it is possible that PrEP-001 could be used as a stand-alone pan-viral prophylaxis or as an adjuvant for live and inactivated or peptide intranasal vaccines targeting specific respiratory viruses. Previous studies in animals have demonstrated that intranasal administration of poly IC shortly after vaccination with live-attenuated, inactivated and haemagglutinin antigen preparations of influenza virus enhanced respiratory dendritic cell function, CD8 T cell formation, and production of neutralizing antibodies. The proposed field trial will provide real world data as a stand-alone prophylaxis against influenza, the common cold, COVID-19 and other respiratory viral illnesses. ""We are excited about these new data allowing us to dose PrEP-001 daily for up to 12 weeks which is the expected length of a typical cold & flu season. We intend to move forward with a field trial to assess the efficacy against a number of common respiratory viruses and provide real world validation of PrEP-001 as a novel pan-viral prophylaxis,"" said Ryan Muldoon, CEO of PrEP Biopharm Limited.

In reality, it was built on more than a decade of research into other viruses at the U.S Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratorys Advanced Photon Source (APS). Five of the vaccines, including those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, contain genetic mutations that increase effectiveness in fighting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This pivotal discovery is based upon work dating back more than 10 years using the resources of the APS, a DOE Office of Science User Facility at Argonne. The mutations were developed by Jason McLellan, now an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, and Barney Graham, currently the deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The pairs current work on COVID-19 vaccines was heavily influenced by their research into an entirely different disease: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which affects thousands per year. Between 2009 and 2013, McLellan, Graham and their colleagues worked to design an RSV vaccine that would target one of the viruss proteins in a more vulnerable form, neutralizing it more effectively. Parts of that work were done at the APS, using ultra-bright X-ray beams to determine the structures of the viruss proteins. The pairs RSV vaccine is now entering phase three trials, but McLellan and Graham soon realized that the same technique could work to inhibit coronaviruses as well. And when the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak began, the two joined forces again to see if their genetic mutation would provide the same advantage against this new virus. The initial results of their work, a mutation called S-2P, is now in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines developed by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson and CureVac. Just as what we learned from previous outbreaks helped to create vaccines and treatments at record speed, what we are learning about SARS-CoV-2 at the APS will help fight not only this outbreak, but future ones, said Stephen Streiffer, Argonnes deputy laboratory director for science and technology and the interim director of the APS.

The proposed field trial will provide real world data as a stand-alone prophylaxis against influenza, the common cold, COVID-19 and other respiratory viral illnesses. ""We are excited about these new data allowing us to dose PrEP-001 daily for up to 12 weeks which is the expected length of a typical cold & flu season. We intend to move forward with a field trial to assess the efficacy against a number of common respiratory viruses and provide real world validation of PrEP-001 as a novel pan-viral prophylaxis,"" said Ryan Muldoon, CEO of PrEP Biopharm Limited. The influenza and rhinovirus market opportunities alone are enormous. But PrEP-001 could also play a meaningful role in the current COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics with other novel respiratory viruses.

Newly approved therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer are set to create a shift in the way that the disease is treated, while creating a competitive environment for new market entrants.Latest Key TakeawaysThe report estimates that in 2018, there were 1.3 million incident cases of prostate cancer worldwide in males aged 40 years and older, and forecasts that number to increase to 1.5 million cases by 2027.In the US, prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy diagnosed in men, and is the second-leading cause of cancer mortality in men behind lung cancer.The overall likelihood of approval of a Phase I prostate cancer asset is 4.9%, and the average probability a drug advances from Phase III is 51.5%. Prostate cancer drugs, on average, take 9.0 years from Phase I to approval, compared to 9.5 years in the overall oncology space.Pfizer\'s next-generation androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor Xtandi is the market leader in prostate cancer due to its established efficacy across prostate cancer segmentations and a lack of near-term generic competition. Bolstered by recent and planned expansions into additional prostate cancer segments, Xtandi will continue to be the leading option in this indication. Future expansion opportunities include potential use in combination with PARP inhibitors Talzenna or Rubraca in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. Xtandi is also being trialed in combination with leuprolide in the Phase III EMBARK study for non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients progressing on definitive therapy. Potential expansion into this segment represents a significant opportunity to improve outcomes earlier in the treatment paradigm, but the combination will have to demonstrate a significant benefit over existing localized treatment options to justify the additional clinical and financial toxicity of Xtandi treatment.Since the launch of generic abiraterone in the US in November 2018, sales of Johnson & Johnson\'s cytochrome P450c17 inhibitor Zytiga have begun to erode. Further generic erosion is expected in the EU and Japanese markets in the next few years, decimating sales of the multi-blockbuster. Although branded Zytiga will continue to decrease in market share, use of abiraterone as part of standard regimens will continue and may expand to include several novel combinations.The PARP inhibitors Rubraca and Lynparza were both approved in the US in May 2020 for the treatment of mCRPC patients following AR inhibitor therapy. Rubraca received accelerated conditional approval in mCRPC with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic), while Lynparza received full approval for use in the broader homologous recombination deficient (HRD) population. To potentially differentiate the PARP assets, both are being trialed in the first-line setting of mCRPC; Rubraca in combination with Xtandi against Xtandi alone, and Lynparza with abiraterone against abiraterone alone. There is potential synergy with these combinations as its hypothesized that AR inhibitors may sensitize tumors to PARP treatment by reducing DNA damage repair (DDR) expression.Late-phase PARP inhibitors Zejula and Talzenna are also being developed in combination with next-generation treatments and will join a crowded PARP treatment space. Zejula is being tested in combination with abiraterone against abiraterone alone as first-line therapy for mCRPC patients. Similarly, Talzenna is being studied in combination with physician\'s choice of Xtandi or enzalutamide in mCRPC patients, also as a first-line option. The potential synergy of the PARP inhibitors with AR modulators is promising, but a strong benefit will have to be seen to justify use in the front-line setting of mCRPC. If approved, it is likely that these regimens will be limited to the HRD or even BRCA populations, where they will have strong utility but somewhat limited commercial impact due to the relatively small prevalence of these biomarkers.Next-generation AR inhibitors Nubeqa and Erleada have shifted the treatment paradigm to include these therapies in earlier segments of disease such as non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Expansion into earlier segments and lines of therapy is ongoing. Bayer is looking to expand Nubeqa\'s label to include use in very high-risk localized patients and metastatic hormone-sensitive patients. Johnson & Johnson will continue to try and differentiate Erleada with an aggressive development plan that includes potential expansions into chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients as part of a combination with abiraterone, as well as into the localized setting for patients treated with prostatectomy or radiation therapy.Akt inhibitors ipatasertib and capivasertib are a potential new mechanistic addition to the prostate cancer space, but the efficacy/tolerability profile of these PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors may prevent approval and potential usage. Ipatasertib is a pan-Akt inhibitor from Roche currently in development for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC patients with PTEN loss as part of a combination with abiraterone. PTEN loss is not a standard target in this indication, but represents a significant market opportunity as it is estimated to occur in approximately 20% of primary prostate cancers and up to 50% of castration-resistant tumors. However, ipatasertib is beset by known class toxicities of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors such as diarrhea, rash, and ALT/AST elevations that could be detrimental to its regulatory chances. AstraZeneca\'s Akt inhibitor capivasertib has also demonstrated mixed results in prostate cancer. In the Phase I/II ProCAID trial, capivasertib in combination with docetaxel failed to meet the primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival in mCRPC patients. However, the combination did improve overall survival in these patients irrespective of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway mutations. This has led to initiation of the Phase III CAPItello-281 trial testing capivasertib in combination with abiraterone in de novo mHSPC with PTEN loss.Several checkpoint inhibitors are in development for prostate cancer, but late-phase data from ongoing combination trials are needed to fully determine their relative outlook in the indication. Merck is pursuing an aggressive late-phase development strategy for Keytruda in prostate cancer that includes combinations with Lynparza, Xtandi, and docetaxel for the treatment of mCRPC patients. Opdivo is also in late-phase development as part of a combination with docetaxel in mCRPC patients after failure on a next-generation hormone therapy. Finally, Roche\'s Tecentriq, the lone anti-PD-L1 antibody in late-phase development for prostate cancer, is currently in Phase III development in combination with Xtandi or in combination with Cabometyx in mCRPC patients after failing on a next-generation hormone therapy.Myovant\'s relugolix is a GnRH receptor antagonist that is differentiated from available GnRH antagonist Firmagon by its oral formulation, which will facilitate use in patients undergoing localized definitive therapy who also need ADT and may also allow use of an intermittent ADT option in advanced hormone-sensitive patients looking to mitigate side effects and maintain quality of life.Key Topics Covered: OVERVIEW Latest key takeaways DISEASE BACKGROUND Definition Risk factors Symptoms Diagnosis Prognosis Patient segmentation Clinical states TREATMENT Referral patterns Localized prostate cancer Locally advanced prostate cancer Metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer Recurrent/progressive prostate cancer Non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer EPIDEMIOLOGY Incidence methodology MARKETED DRUGSPIPELINE DRUGSKEY REGULATORY EVENTS Telix Takes Radiopharmaceutical Route To Prostate Cancer Market AstraZeneca/Merck\'s Lynparza Gets Second Line Prostate Cancer Indication Clovis\'s Rubraca Is First PARP For Prostate Cancer, But AZ\'s Lynparza Coming Soon Myovant Submits First NDA For Relugolix, Plans Another In May Trial Issues Complicate Tookad\'s Path To Approval Steba\'s Tookad: US FDA Panel To Weigh Novel Endpoints, Missing Data And Toxicities PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSLICENSING AND ASSET ACQUISITION DEALS Diaprost Obtains PSA Antibody IP From Memorial Sloan Kettering AZ Divests Arimidex And Casodex Rights To Juvise Lantheus Buys Progenics To Combine Radiopharmaceuticals With Precision Diagnostics CLINICAL TRIAL LANDSCAPE Sponsors by status Sponsors by phase Recent events DRUG ASSESSMENT MODELMARKET DYNAMICSFUTURE TRENDS Xtandi will remain the best-selling therapy over the next decade Abiraterone generics have largely displaced Zytiga prescribing Johnson & Johnson will rely on Erleada to offset Zytiga revenue losses Prescribing of next-generation hormone therapies in earlier treatment settings will drive growth of the market Pipeline drugs targeting mCRPC patients will generate only moderate uptake CONSENSUS FORECASTSRECENT EVENTS AND ANALYST OPINION Relugolix for Prostate Cancer (September 29, 2020) AMG 160 for Prostate Cancer (September 21, 2020) Ipatasertib for Prostate Cancer (September 20, 2020) Ipatasertib for Prostate Cancer (June 18, 2020) Capivasertib for Prostate Cancer (May 30, 2020) Relugolix for Prostate Cancer (May 29, 2020) HPN424 for Prostate Cancer (May 29, 2020) Lutetium 177Lu-PSMA-617 for Prostate Cancer (May 13, 2020) Tookad for Prostate Cancer (February 26, 2020) Tookad for Prostate Cancer (February 24, 2020) Multiple Drugs for Prostate Cancer (February 13, 2020) Cabometyx / Cometriq for Prostate Cancer (February 10, 2020) Relugolix for Prostate Cancer (November 19, 2019) KEY UPCOMING EVENTSKEY OPINION LEADER INSIGHTSBIBLIOGRAPHY Prescription information APPENDIXFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/z438b Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.

The first entry features a curated selection of malicious behaviors used by the cybercrime group known as FIN6. Security analysts believe that FIN6 is a financially motivated cybercrime group that has compromised high-volume point-of-sale systems in the hospitality and retail sectors since at least 2015. The group has focused on U.S. and European e-commerce sites and multinational organizations, though it has targeted companies based in other countries as well. FireEye estimates that the group has stolen $400 million via credit card data. The FIN6 adversary emulation plan includes a detailed intelligence summary and a step-by-step guide for emulating the group. It gives red team operators a series of scripts and commands that can be easily extracted and used in a repeatable fashion to emulate adversary behavior. While the FIN6 plan is the initial entry in the library, the Center and its research participants will be adding additional adversary emulation plans on a regular basis. This library makes it much easier for defenders around the world to assess their own environments against the threat posed by specific adversaries and use the results to rapidly improve their organizations cybersecurity posture, said Richard Struse, Center director. Creating publicly available resources that empower organizations to make evidence-based decisions and investments is at the heart of the Centers purpose. Microsoft believes the key to getting ahead of attackers is to think as they do, and the only way to do that is by learning their techniques. This new library of attacker techniques will enable defenders to more quickly, efficiently, and accurately emulate attacks from a dangerous actor targeting financial services companies, FIN6, said Dana Baril, senior security research lead at Microsoft Security. Microsoft is honored to take part in contributing to and sponsoring this library that will help improve overall defense capabilities to detect and block these techniques at first sight. This is an historic first, and as a founding research partner of the Center for Threat-Informed Defense, I am immensely proud that AttackIQ is working with MITRE and the Center team to make this emulation plan publicly available, said Carl Wright, chief commercial officer at AttackIQ. Too many organizations lack the resources to study adversaries and build these emulation plans. We are working in the public interest to help every organization become more resilient to cyberattacks. We were excited to collaborate with other industry leaders through the Center to develop the FIN6 adversary emulation plan, said Manabu Muramatsu, senior director of cybersecurity, Infrastructure Service Division in the Defense Systems Unit at Fujitsu Limited. We plan to leverage the plan to help our customers better protect themselves. The adversary emulation library is available in the Centers GitHub organization [https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library] and is released under the Apache 2 license. The emulation plan is available for security teams to use themselves, as well as in machine-readable form for use with automated tools. About MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense The Center is a nonprofit, privately funded research and development organization currently comprised of 23 organizations from around the globe with highly sophisticated security teams. Together with Research Participants, the Center builds on MITRE ATT&CK, an important foundation for threat-informed defense used by security teams and vendors in their enterprise security operations. Because the Center operates for the public good, outputs of its research and development are available publicly and for the benefit of all. https://mitre-engenuity.org/center-for-threat-informed-defense/', 'SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Yugabyte, the leader in open source distributed SQL databases, today announced that Justuno has selected YugabyteDB as its database of choice for its visitor conversion platform. After previously using a variety of databases including Microsoft SQL Server and CockroachDB, Justuno selected Yugabytes distributed SQL database for its simplified, on-demand scalability, low latency reads, and robust open source features to power its SaaS conversion optimization solution. Justuno delivers incredible value to more than 188,000 e-commerce websites, and in doing so, it puts major demands on our data platform. We store a massive amount of data, and our database needs to be able to handle a high level of operations per second with almost zero latency so that we can serve personalized promotions to website visitors and optimize conversions for our customers, said Travis Logan, CTO, Justuno. YugabyteDB has the high performance and SQL features we need, while also making it easy to scale horizontally, which is essential for our business as we prepare for the holiday season (the busiest time for e-commerce merchants using Justuno). Justuno uses visitor intelligence data to surface deeper insights and deliver targeted on-site messaging designed to turn site visitors into customers. To deliver these insights, Justuno processes a massive amount of data, tracking between 30 and 50 data points per visitor such as time on site, products viewed, and items added to the shopping cart, to create relevant and personalized experiences for site visitors. To power its platform as it moved to a modern, cloud native architecture, Justuno needed a solution that could handle all these operations at very low latency. Justuno moved away from CockroachDB for YugabyteDBs important SQL features like stored procedures and low latency with the ability to dramatically scale the amount of data being processed. Justuno also appreciated YugabyteDBs flexible database features like open source backups. Justuno is doing very innovative things with data, analyzing billions of data points every day, and making intelligent visitor data instantly available to customers to help them improve sales and the customer experience at the same time, said Karthik Ranganathan, CTO, Yugabyte. Because customer data is on the line, scaling on demand using simple point-and-click operations while maintaining consistent performance is required, which makes YugabyteDB managed by the Yugabyte Platform a natural fit. We are delighted to have Justuno as a customer and partner in our mission to drive distributed SQL technology forward. Their success is our success, and we are honored to work with them. Justunos e-commerce customers regularly experience significant demand spikes, making it necessary for Justuno to quickly add or subtract nodes. The Yugabyte Platform is an all-in-one database solution with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface enabling point-and click administration for the Justuno team. As a result of the implementation, Justuno was able to run the same workloads with YugabyteDB using only 30 percent of the nodes that were previously required. This resulted in significant cost savings in both infrastructure and operations. The lower TCO will continue as Justuno scales its business beyond 188,000+ customers. Resources required for tasks such as provisioning new servers have also been simplified thanks to the Yugabyte Platform, reducing the DevOps teams involvement to just a few clicks, allowing the Justuno team to spend more time on innovation and less on basic maintenance.

The first entry features a curated selection of malicious behaviors used by the cybercrime group known as FIN6. Security analysts believe that FIN6 is a financially motivated cybercrime group that has compromised high-volume point-of-sale systems in the hospitality and retail sectors since at least 2015. The group has focused on U.S. and European e-commerce sites and multinational organizations, though it has targeted companies based in other countries as well. FireEye estimates that the group has stolen $400 million via credit card data. The FIN6 adversary emulation plan includes a detailed intelligence summary and a step-by-step guide for emulating the group. It gives red team operators a series of scripts and commands that can be easily extracted and used in a repeatable fashion to emulate adversary behavior. While the FIN6 plan is the initial entry in the library, the Center and its research participants will be adding additional adversary emulation plans on a regular basis. This library makes it much easier for defenders around the world to assess their own environments against the threat posed by specific adversaries and use the results to rapidly improve their organizations cybersecurity posture, said Richard Struse, Center director. Creating publicly available resources that empower organizations to make evidence-based decisions and investments is at the heart of the Centers purpose. Microsoft believes the key to getting ahead of attackers is to think as they do, and the only way to do that is by learning their techniques. This new library of attacker techniques will enable defenders to more quickly, efficiently, and accurately emulate attacks from a dangerous actor targeting financial services companies, FIN6, said Dana Baril, senior security research lead at Microsoft Security. Microsoft is honored to take part in contributing to and sponsoring this library that will help improve overall defense capabilities to detect and block these techniques at first sight. This is an historic first, and as a founding research partner of the Center for Threat-Informed Defense, I am immensely proud that AttackIQ is working with MITRE and the Center team to make this emulation plan publicly available, said Carl Wright, chief commercial officer at AttackIQ. Too many organizations lack the resources to study adversaries and build these emulation plans. We are working in the public interest to help every organization become more resilient to cyberattacks. We were excited to collaborate with other industry leaders through the Center to develop the FIN6 adversary emulation plan, said Manabu Muramatsu, senior director of cybersecurity, Infrastructure Service Division in the Defense Systems Unit at Fujitsu Limited. We plan to leverage the plan to help our customers better protect themselves. The adversary emulation library is available in the Centers GitHub organization [https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library] and is released under the Apache 2 license. The emulation plan is available for security teams to use themselves, as well as in machine-readable form for use with automated tools. About MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense The Center is a nonprofit, privately funded research and development organization currently comprised of 23 organizations from around the globe with highly sophisticated security teams. Together with Research Participants, the Center builds on MITRE ATT&CK, an important foundation for threat-informed defense used by security teams and vendors in their enterprise security operations. Because the Center operates for the public good, outputs of its research and development are available publicly and for the benefit of all. https://mitre-engenuity.org/center-for-threat-informed-defense/', 'SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Yugabyte, the leader in open source distributed SQL databases, today announced that Justuno has selected YugabyteDB as its database of choice for its visitor conversion platform. After previously using a variety of databases including Microsoft SQL Server and CockroachDB, Justuno selected Yugabytes distributed SQL database for its simplified, on-demand scalability, low latency reads, and robust open source features to power its SaaS conversion optimization solution. Justuno delivers incredible value to more than 188,000 e-commerce websites, and in doing so, it puts major demands on our data platform. We store a massive amount of data, and our database needs to be able to handle a high level of operations per second with almost zero latency so that we can serve personalized promotions to website visitors and optimize conversions for our customers, said Travis Logan, CTO, Justuno. YugabyteDB has the high performance and SQL features we need, while also making it easy to scale horizontally, which is essential for our business as we prepare for the holiday season (the busiest time for e-commerce merchants using Justuno). Justuno uses visitor intelligence data to surface deeper insights and deliver targeted on-site messaging designed to turn site visitors into customers. To deliver these insights, Justuno processes a massive amount of data, tracking between 30 and 50 data points per visitor such as time on site, products viewed, and items added to the shopping cart, to create relevant and personalized experiences for site visitors. To power its platform as it moved to a modern, cloud native architecture, Justuno needed a solution that could handle all these operations at very low latency. Justuno moved away from CockroachDB for YugabyteDBs important SQL features like stored procedures and low latency with the ability to dramatically scale the amount of data being processed. Justuno also appreciated YugabyteDBs flexible database features like open source backups. Justuno is doing very innovative things with data, analyzing billions of data points every day, and making intelligent visitor data instantly available to customers to help them improve sales and the customer experience at the same time, said Karthik Ranganathan, CTO, Yugabyte. Because customer data is on the line, scaling on demand using simple point-and-click operations while maintaining consistent performance is required, which makes YugabyteDB managed by the Yugabyte Platform a natural fit. We are delighted to have Justuno as a customer and partner in our mission to drive distributed SQL technology forward. Their success is our success, and we are honored to work with them. Justunos e-commerce customers regularly experience significant demand spikes, making it necessary for Justuno to quickly add or subtract nodes. The Yugabyte Platform is an all-in-one database solution with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface enabling point-and click administration for the Justuno team. As a result of the implementation, Justuno was able to run the same workloads with YugabyteDB using only 30 percent of the nodes that were previously required. This resulted in significant cost savings in both infrastructure and operations. The lower TCO will continue as Justuno scales its business beyond 188,000+ customers. Resources required for tasks such as provisioning new servers have also been simplified thanks to the Yugabyte Platform, reducing the DevOps teams involvement to just a few clicks, allowing the Justuno team to spend more time on innovation and less on basic maintenance. For further information on Justunos work with Yugabyte visit www.yugabyte.com/success-stories/justuno/ and join the session on Sept. 17 at 1 pm PT at the free Distributed SQL Virtual Summit.

Amazons Climate Pledge Fund and Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) co-led the investment syndicate comprising Microsoft, BDC Capital, 2150, Thistledown Capital, Taronga Ventures, and GreenSoil Investments. The investment represents a commitment to tackling the carbon footprint of concrete, the most abundant human-made material in the world. Cement the key ingredient that gives concrete its strength is also one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the built environment. This collaborative investment by technology and property development firms is a great endorsement of CarbonCure as the go-to CDR solution for the growing tech construction space and the overall shift towards low embodied carbon construction materials, said Robert Niven, CEO and Co-Founder of CarbonCure Technologies. We witnessed the tech industry setting climate change trends with their adoption of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. This investment in CDR signals a broader change for public and private infrastructure projects as industries and governments turn their focus toward the reduction of embodied carbon, said Niven. In 2019, Amazon co-founded the Climate Pledge, a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. Amazons investment in CarbonCure aligns with this commitment. We are excited to invest in CarbonCure, a company producing stronger, more sustainable concrete, which will help Amazon and other companies meet The Climate Pledge, a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040, said Kara Hurst, Vice President of Sustainability, Amazon. We are looking forward to lowering the carbon footprint of many of our buildings by using CarbonCure concrete, including in Amazons HQ2 building in Virginia. CarbonCure intends to use the capital investment to accelerate its product roadmap and geographical expansion in order to meet its goal of removing 500 megatonnes (500 million metric tonnes or 500 Mt) of carbon dioxide annually from the concrete industry by 2030. Our solutions help producers deliver low embodied carbon concrete in an efficient, non-disruptive, and profitable way, said Niven. The latest investment presents a wonderful opportunity for the global concrete industry to capitalize on the increasing demand for sustainable concrete. CarbonCure is already used by nearly 300 concrete producers to supply low embodied carbon concrete to construction projects. CarbonCures success in North America is validation that its cleantech solution benefits concrete producers from a commercial standpoint as well as a sustainability one, said Dr. Carmichael Roberts from BEV. BEV is delighted to co-lead this investment with Amazon so CarbonCure can accelerate its global expansion, enabling more producers around the world to deliver low embodied carbon concrete. Microsoft, another prominent tech company in CarbonCures investment syndicate, also has ambitious sustainability commitments. Achieving a net zero carbon future requires developing innovative new technologies to address carbon emissions across industries, said Brandon Middaugh, Director of Microsofts Climate Innovation Fund. Solutions like CarbonCure help to reduce carbon emissions from the concrete industry, which is a large producer of carbon, and help us meet our goal to be carbon negative by 2030. About CarbonCure CarbonCure Technologies is the global leader in carbon removal technologies for concrete. CarbonCures retrofit technology enables concrete producers to use waste carbon dioxide (CO) to produce stronger, more sustainable concrete and gain a competitive advantage. CarbonCure is on a mission to reduce the embodied carbon footprint of the built environment, with the goal of reducing CO emissions by 500 megatonnes annually.

Additional investors in the round include Rise of the Rest, Good Growth Capital, Engage Ventures and former Venrock Managing Partner Ray Rothrock. The latest round of funding will be used to accelerate product development efforts for building applications that utilize W3C verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers (DID).

We couldn't ask for a better group of investors to bolster our platform during a time of rapid blockchain innovation, said Fluree Co-CEO Brian Platz. As data-centric security, verifiable credentials and secure data sharing become the cornerstones of Web 3.0, Fluree and our trusted investors are becoming key players in the internet of tomorrow. The Web 3.0 Data Management Platform As Web 2.0 continues to sag under the weight of excessive integrations and costly and insecure data lakes, the Fluree platform heralds a new era of secure, trustworthy data management.

Fluree is available on all leading cloud providers, including Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. Investor Perspectives on Fluree Seed Funding Round The power of data-centricity is evident in the market dominance and profitability of data-centric companies, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Flurees mission is to enable enterprises to evolve from their current state of being application-centric to becoming data-centric, said Dan Malven, managing director of 4490 Ventures. Becoming data centric using current data management products is too difficult and expensive for 99% of the worlds enterprises. Not only does Fluree take out massive cost elements of becoming data centric, it enables a whole suite of new capabilities that not even the largest companies can build today without storing their data in a platform such as Flurees. The biggest organizations in the world are universally experiencing major challenges with storing, securing, and sharing the massive amounts of data generated every day in the enterprise, said Thiago Olsen, managing director at Engage. The need to break down data silos and become a data-centric organization is becoming increasingly urgent, and we believe that Flurees approach to make data self-securing and portable provides a powerful platform to facilitate this transformation. We are pleased to expand on our partnership and support the growth of the Fluree team. With the advent of Web 3.0 machine-to-machine real-time AI applications, cybersecurity approaches need to move away from only allowing stage-gate access to data to allowing multi-party real-time access to data while still ensuring its integrity, and Flurees blockchain-based data platform does just that. Fluree represents a groundbreaking innovation that will power the internet applications of tomorrow, said Ray Rothrock, former Managing Partner of Venrock and long-time cybersecurity investor who has led early-stage investments in other groundbreaking IT security companies such as Check Point Software (NASDAQ: CHKP, market cap $16B), Cloudflare (NYSE: NET, market cap $11B) and Shape Security (acquired by F5 Networks for $1B).

OpenTelemetry is the vendor-neutral open source project that is setting the standard for how engineering teams go about capturing complex system data. The new OpenTelemetry Launchers connect that data with Lightstep for unprecedented observability and actionable insights. We understand that not every organization is Google, and that distributed tracing used to be a cumbersome integration for many engineering teams thats why its been a top priority for us to simplify things as much as possible, said Ben Sigelman, CEO and Co-Founder of Lightstep. Weve been working hard alongside Google, Microsoft, Splunk, and other great companies to set the standard for how to collect data from distributed systems with the OpenTelemetry project. And with our new OpenTelemetry Launchers, anyone can gather and gain insight from that data with only one line of code. Lightstep aims to address the challenges around performance and root cause analysis introduced by emerging technologies such as microservices and serverless. Research from Lightstep highlights that while over 90% of software engineers currently use or plan to adopt microservices, almost all of them find it challenging. In Gartners report Innovation Insight for Microservices, they write microservices enable unprecedented agility and scalability but note that the architecture causes significant cultural disruption. Gartner goes on to state that microservices adoption efforts are destined to fail if you dont make corresponding changes to traditional application development and data management. This shift to distributed architectures is changing how performance data is collected, away from the proprietary agents used by more traditional APM and monitoring vendors, toward open source tooling. In their report Critical Capabilities for Application Performance Monitoring, Gartner also writes that by 2025, 50% of new, cloud-native application monitoring will use open-source instrumentation, instead of vendor-specific agents for improved interoperability, which is an increase from 5% in 2019. OpenTelemetrys top contributors are leading companies such as Google, Microsoft, Lightstep, Splunk, Uber, New Relic, Honeycomb and others. It comes with built-in, high-quality instrumentation for dozens of popular libraries in each language, out of the box. This makes it possible to get up and running with distributed tracing in minutes when connecting with Lightsteps OpenTelemetry Launchers, enabling engineers to gain immediate, accessible end-to-end visibility into distributed services and their dependencies. Supporting Quotes Lightstep is being able to see where you were blind before. Its the difference between never finding the problem or never really being able to understand whats going on, and instantaneously seeing all the relevant information. -- Albert Strasheim, Director of Engineering at Segment Not only does Lightstep help us with understanding the edges of our system, it allows us to monitor and understand new usage patterns that we want to keep a closer eye on to ensure we have an optimal customer experience. It shows us exactly where things are slow, what changes we need to make to realize a quick ROI, and specifically how our customers are experiencing our platform. -- Philip Zeyliger, Software Engineer at Airtable About OpenTelemetry A CNCF Sandbox project, OpenTelemetry is an open source project that aims to make observability more accessible for all.

Shrugging off COVID-19 concerns, the webscale sector witnessed yet another strong quarter in 2Q20 aided by continued investments in network infrastructure. Single-quarter revenue growth inched past the pre-COVID levels (14.3% in 4Q19) to post 15.1% in 2Q20 year-on-year (YoY). However, growth is still lower than the peak levels of +18% recorded during 3Q17-3Q18 period. On an annualized basis, the sector\'s top-line grew by 13.5% YoY in 2Q20. The network spending of big webscalers is centered around immense, hyperscale data centers and undersea cable systems that support network traffic from the tech companies\' online retail, video, and social media platforms, along with cloud services. Webscale network operators (WNOs) may also own access networks, typically using fiber, microwave or mmWave, and even fixed satellite. WNOs exploring outer space for providing connectivity include Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft.

The $24 million B1 round of funding had wide participation from new investors alongside existing investors - Spring Lake Equity Partners, Marker, New Enterprise Associates, Bessemer Venture Partners, Innovation Endeavors, Cisco, Microsoft, Citi and others. Ofer Israeli, CEO and founder, Illusive Networks, said: ""Our rapid growth is a testament to the need for our solution, especially with the rise of cyber-attacks and the complexity of securing remote workers which makes our products more critical at this time. We are also thrilled about the tremendous momentum we are seeing with our strategic partnerships like Microsoft; last week Illusive was announced as the only deception vendor with a Microsoft ""co-sell"" ready status."" This funding round will be used to accelerate the company\'s next phase of growth driven by an aggressive go-to-market strategy that focuses on sales and marketing expansion and further investment and product enhancements for securing cloud workloads. Jeff Williams, founding partner, Spring Lake Equity Partners, said: ""Cyber-attackers are savvier than ever in evading security monitoring and controls. The next level of cybersecurity needs to be deterministic, not reactionary. Illusive will also further invest in cloud security and make product enhancements that are critical as enterprises are increasing their deployment of workloads in the cloud. That\'s why Illusive will continue to grow and why it\'s a company worth investing in."" Illusive Networks is gaining market share at a time when validation and support for deception and active defense continue to grow. Having a proactive defense strategy is now recognized as a critical layer of the security stack, as highlighted by the MITRE SHIELD Framework. Dave DeWalt, Vice Chairman of Illusive and Founder of NightDragon, said: ""Despite massive investments, enterprises continue to suffer data breaches. The Illusive solution enables the active layer of defense that deterministically detects attackers in the network who are leveraging stolen credentials or stealing sensitive data. This is a critical layer of defense that enterprises need to deploy."" Illusive has also brought on several strategic new hires to lead the company into a new era of growth and continues investment in the go-to-market strategy. These include Bob Horn, chief revenue officer; Nicole Bucala, vice president of business development; and Claire Trimble, chief marketing officer. To see Illusive in action, request a demowith a security expert. About Illusive Networks Illusive reduces cyber risk by shrinking the attack surface and stopping attacker movement. Illusive creates a hostile environment for attackers, depriving them of the means to progress towards critical assets after breaching the perimeter. Hackers are increasingly finding more vulnerabilities within an enterprise\'s security stack, allowing them to move laterally within the network and conduct reconnaissance and exfiltration. Illusive identifies and removes the vulnerable connections and credentials that enable attackers to move undetected, and then replaces them with deceptive versions that fool attackers into revealing their presence upon engagement. Unlike behavioral or anomaly-based threat detection, Illusive\'s agentless approach captures deterministic proof of in-progress attacks and provides actionable forensics to empower a quick and effective response.

The FAA\'s action allows DroneSeed to begin reforesting in California once a fire is contained and airspace is clear. The company will select specific sites affected by fires later this month and is receiving information from impacted forest managers via droneseed.com. Once sites are selected, DroneSeed will manufacture seed vessels with native Douglas Fir and Ponderosa Pine. The approval from the FAA is a first for the agency, as each of DroneSeed\'s aircraft carry a 57-pound payload and operate in swarms of up to five aircraft. This is the third precedent-setting FAA approval the company has earned, a significant achievement for the startup. DroneSeed is the only company in the United States legally approved to operate with heavy-lift drone swarms. DroneSeed has developed the capability to reforest after wildfires within 60 days. The company, which utilizes drone swarms to fly over rough terrain, boosts seed establishment rates with patented seed vessels. This rapid response avoids adding more reforestation debt to the increasing national backlog of forests that aren\'t re-establishing due to the size and severity of wildfires. The speed also reduces forest manager weed removal costs of invasive species that grow over the two to three year period while nursery trees grow. ""As these devastating wildfires have directly and indirectly impacted most Americans, it has been extremely hard for me to watch friends, investors, and communities lose people, property, and livelihoods,"" said Grant Canary, CEO of DroneSeed. ""Our team is highly motivated to help communities begin the process of restoring the forests we lost, make sure they come back, and evolve new tools to make reforestation scalable. It\'s imperative if we\'re to mitigate the worst effects of climate change."" In addition to California, DroneSeed is currently fielding inquiries and actively selecting sites for reforestation for multiple fires in Oregon and Washington. Individuals, businesses and organizations with forests affected by fires can send information about their land and the fire impact via DroneSeed\'s website. An additional service, DroneSeed offers interested forest owners a portion of carbon credit sales for the post-fire reforestation--lowering costs. The company is matching these owners with tech companies, such as Microsoft, that have announcedthey will go carbon negative. ""Previously carbon credits only worked for established forests, and that\'s now expanded to planting forests--especially those impacted by fires,"" Canary said about the effort. ""The Climate Action Reserve has developed the standards to connect reforestation to California\'s carbon offset market and project forward."" Canary outlined the relatively simple process and how it pays off in the long run for investors and the climate. ""At the outset, create a super conservative baseline of tree survival and carbon capture rate by species,"" Canary commented. ""A year after seed vessel dispersal an independent third party checks the survival. If it\'s successful, credits are issued and money is exchanged. Then after five years, the trees are checked again, and if the conservative baseline is exceeded more credits can be issued. Stay tuned to see how this dramatically changes things--and come talk to us corporate America--there\'s dramatic demand and not enough supply. We\'re building that supply for partners.""

The $24 million B1 round of funding had wide participation from new investors alongside existing investors - Spring Lake Equity Partners, Marker, New Enterprise Associates, Bessemer Venture Partners, Innovation Endeavors, Cisco, Microsoft, Citi and others. Ofer Israeli, CEO and founder, Illusive Networks, said: ""Our rapid growth is a testament to the need for our solution, especially with the rise of cyber-attacks and the complexity of securing remote workers which makes our products more critical at this time. We are also thrilled about the tremendous momentum we are seeing with our strategic partnerships like Microsoft; last week Illusive was announced as the only deception vendor with a Microsoft ""co-sell"" ready status."" This funding round will be used to accelerate the company\'s next phase of growth driven by an aggressive go-to-market strategy that focuses on sales and marketing expansion and further investment and product enhancements for securing cloud workloads. Jeff Williams, founding partner, Spring Lake Equity Partners, said: ""Cyber-attackers are savvier than ever in evading security monitoring and controls. The next level of cybersecurity needs to be deterministic, not reactionary. Illusive will also further invest in cloud security and make product enhancements that are critical as enterprises are increasing their deployment of workloads in the cloud. That\'s why Illusive will continue to grow and why it\'s a company worth investing in."" Illusive Networks is gaining market share at a time when validation and support for deception and active defense continue to grow. Having a proactive defense strategy is now recognized as a critical layer of the security stack, as highlighted by the MITRE SHIELD Framework. Dave DeWalt, Vice Chairman of Illusive and Founder of NightDragon, said: ""Despite massive investments, enterprises continue to suffer data breaches. The Illusive solution enables the active layer of defense that deterministically detects attackers in the network who are leveraging stolen credentials or stealing sensitive data. This is a critical layer of defense that enterprises need to deploy."" Illusive has also brought on several strategic new hires to lead the company into a new era of growth and continues investment in the go-to-market strategy. These include Bob Horn, chief revenue officer; Nicole Bucala, vice president of business development; and Claire Trimble, chief marketing officer. To see Illusive in action, request a demowith a security expert. About Illusive Networks Illusive reduces cyber risk by shrinking the attack surface and stopping attacker movement. Illusive creates a hostile environment for attackers, depriving them of the means to progress towards critical assets after breaching the perimeter. Hackers are increasingly finding more vulnerabilities within an enterprise\'s security stack, allowing them to move laterally within the network and conduct reconnaissance and exfiltration. Illusive identifies and removes the vulnerable connections and credentials that enable attackers to move undetected, and then replaces them with deceptive versions that fool attackers into revealing their presence upon engagement. Unlike behavioral or anomaly-based threat detection, Illusive\'s agentless approach captures deterministic proof of in-progress attacks and provides actionable forensics to empower a quick and effective response.

WNOs exploring outer space for providing connectivity include Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft. Out of these, Amazon\'s efforts gained fruition recently with the FCC approval for its satellite broadband initiative, Project Kuiper, to deploy and operate a constellation of 3,200+ low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Satellite investments from non-webscale players such as SpaceX (Starlink) are heightening the webscale activity. A broad set of vendors are benefiting from WNO Capex spending - from semiconductor players selling into the data center market (Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, etc), to optical components & transport vendors selling into data center interconnect markets (Ciena, Infinera, Neophotonics, Lumentum, etc.), to contract manufacturers of white box/OCP servers (Wistron and Quanta). Infrastructure upgrades continue to drive Capex, while R&D growth experiences a slowdown Capex spend saw a sequential surge of more than 20%, posting 20.4% YoY growth in 2Q20 (25% YoY growth in 1Q20). A portion of this strong growth in the first two quarters could also be attributed to a lower base in the corresponding quarters of the prior year, considering falloffs in three out of four quarters in 2019, which included double-digit declines of 17.5% and 11.4% during 1Q19 and 2Q19, respectively. But that doesn\'t take away much from the efforts of the operators who continued to add more servers and networking related equipment in their data centers to keep up with the demand of remote access to cloud-based tools and services. New data center construction, though, did not contribute much to Capex growth in the first half of the year. The strong uptick in the latest quarter also aided in Capex growth on an annualized basis, posting an overall increase of 9% in 2Q20. Annualized Capex reached an all-time high in 2Q20, hitting $114.4 billion; the previous high was $113.1B in 4Q18. One positive was the increased spending by China-based WNOs such as Alibaba and Tencent, who are caught in the midst of the US-China trade headwinds and restrictions. Both these operators have pledged to invest billions of dollars in next-generation mega data centers, semiconductors, servers, and related technologies. Some of those investments reflected in the latest quarter, boosting single quarter Capex for China-based WNOs by 88% YoY in 2Q20. Growth in R&D investments, though, slowed down to post 12.3% YoY growth in 2Q20 (vs. 15.1% in 1Q20), and unlike Capex growth, it failed to track near pre-COVID levels (18.6% YoY growth in 4Q19). On an annualized basis, these investments clocked 16.0% YoY growth to post $164.8B for the 12 months ended June 2020. This is important because overall, WNOs spend more on R&D than Capex - as a percentage of revenues, annualized R&D/revenues were 10.7% in 2Q20 vs. 7.4% annualized Capex/revenues. Despite this, the long-term growth story for the webscale sector looks intact. The sector\'s cash & short-term investments growth also remained steady throughout the COVID crisis, logging 10.8% YoY growth in 2Q20, the same growth rate as 1Q20. Spending and investment trends by key operators A sub-group of important WNOs, the Top 8, continues to be important for tracking the sector. This group includes Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Facebook, Microsoft, and Tencent. Four of these accounted for at least 10% of total WNO Capex in the twelve-month period ending June 2020 - all based in the US: Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. Half of the Top 8 WNOs - Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, and Baidu - spent less on Capex in 2Q20 than in 2Q19. For eCommerce-based WNOs such as Amazon (109% YoY growth in Capex), Alibaba (102%), and JD.com (87%), Capex growth has been a reaction to the COVID-19 situation - their spending focused on fulfillment centers and supporting technology, but also targeted cloud operations, for Amazon and Alibaba in particular. Capex-related developments for select WNOs are summarized below: Alibaba: announced plans for US$28B of investments over several years for building data centers, chips, and servers Alphabet/Google: the company plans to recalibrate\' data center spend and freeze hiring new staff due to COVID-19 Microsoft: expects healthy Capex in 3Q20 to meet the surge in demand across its cloud-based tools and platforms Facebook: halted two data center projects (Alabama in United States, and Ireland) in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Data center construction in New Albany halted in August 2020. US$800M data center coming up in Gallatin, Tennessee Tencent: announced plans for US$70B spending over the next five years to build new data centers and infrastructure to boost its cloud computing capabilities With respect to R&D spending, webscale operators continued spending more on R&D than Capex; annualized R&D/revenues were 10.7% in 2Q20, ahead of the Capex/revenues ratio of 7.4%. Webscale operators are plowing R&D funds into a broad range of tech projects, in both predictable areas like artificial intelligence and IoT, and less obvious areas like healthcare (Amazon and Google), food delivery (Alibaba), and connected cars/self-driving (Baidu). Many webscale operators are designing their own chips now, in potential competition with current suppliers; the publisher\'s Webscale Playbook series details these efforts. M&A activity in the sector posted a strong performance in the twelve-months ending 2Q20, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and HPE each recording sizable MA costs. However, IBM\'s $34B acquisition of Red Hat stole the show during the twelve-month period. Webscale operators are also beginning to more actively partner with telcos on network projects, with Facebook\'s $5.7B splash on a stake purchase in Jio Platforms. Microsoft is also leading the way with recent big wins at AT&T and Jio in India. IBM, already a big supplier in the telco segment, will use its Red Hat acquisition to further these aspirations. Going forward, spending growth will be tested by demand volatility and supply chain constraints The current pandemic situation has somewhat proved to be a silver lining for large WNOs with strong and sizeable cloud businesses and offerings, as lockdown measures across major economies have resulted in a spike of remote access to cloud-based tools and services. However, they are also faced with two key obstacles: Slowdown in enterprise spending: New enterprise customers are hard to come by, given the spending cutbacks amid the pandemic situation. Amazon\'s CFO, Brian Olsavsky, already acknowledged this during the recent analyst call when asked about AWS\' slowing growth. Supply chain headwinds: With COVID cases continuing to rise in major economies, lack of high-technology components for network infrastructure along with delayed shipments have caused disruption to the supply chains worldwide. From the operators\' point of view, WNOs with significant dependence on non-cloud\' businesses and relatively smaller players will likely restrict their spend on webscale buildouts/data centers in 2H20 - as seen with Apple and Facebook. They must prepare to counter the effects of supply chain and workforce disruptions until the pandemic subsides considerably. While both the quarters in the first half of the year saw Capex growth surging above 20% YoY, overall, it is unlikely to sustain into the rest of the year and is expected to be in the 8-15% range. The 2Q20 WNO Market Review analyzes the network infrastructure spending and financial position of webscale network operators (WNOs). WNOs are web-centric companies who own and operate large multi-country communications networks based upon hyperscale data centers and submarine cables. Webscale operators may also own access networks, typically using fixed satellite or fiber. WNOs own network assets in order to support their core businesses, which comprise digital advertising, online retail, cloud, digital media and content services, and other digital-based services. The webscale segment excludes companies with digital business models who rely primarily on rented cloud capacity or collocation space. Twitter, for instance, is not a webscale operator, as its network relies on a mix of rented space in carrier-neutral data centers and rented cloud resources from Google. By contrast, Apple is webscale; although it has partnerships with GCP and AWS for cloud capacity, Apple owns several large data centers, and is building more. WNOs tracked in this report include the Top 8 companies (Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Facebook, Microsoft, and Tencent) and 12 others: Altaba, ChinaCache, Cognizant, eBay, Fujitsu, HPE, IBM, JD.COM, LinkedIn, Oracle, SAP, and Yandex.

Shrugging off COVID-19 concerns, the webscale sector witnessed yet another strong quarter in 2Q20 aided by continued investments in network infrastructure. Single-quarter revenue growth inched past the pre-COVID levels (14.3% in 4Q19) to post 15.1% in 2Q20 year-on-year (YoY). However, growth is still lower than the peak levels of +18% recorded during 3Q17-3Q18 period. On an annualized basis, the sector\'s top-line grew by 13.5% YoY in 2Q20. The network spending of big webscalers is centered around immense, hyperscale data centers and undersea cable systems that support network traffic from the tech companies\' online retail, video, and social media platforms, along with cloud services. Webscale network operators (WNOs) may also own access networks, typically using fiber, microwave or mmWave, and even fixed satellite. WNOs exploring outer space for providing connectivity include Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft. Out of these, Amazon\'s efforts gained fruition recently with the FCC approval for its satellite broadband initiative, Project Kuiper, to deploy and operate a constellation of 3,200+ low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Satellite investments from non-webscale players such as SpaceX (Starlink) are heightening the webscale activity. A broad set of vendors are benefiting from WNO Capex spending - from semiconductor players selling into the data center market (Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, etc), to optical components & transport vendors selling into data center interconnect markets (Ciena, Infinera, Neophotonics, Lumentum, etc.), to contract manufacturers of white box/OCP servers (Wistron and Quanta). Infrastructure upgrades continue to drive Capex, while R&D growth experiences a slowdown Capex spend saw a sequential surge of more than 20%, posting 20.4% YoY growth in 2Q20 (25% YoY growth in 1Q20). A portion of this strong growth in the first two quarters could also be attributed to a lower base in the corresponding quarters of the prior year, considering falloffs in three out of four quarters in 2019, which included double-digit declines of 17.5% and 11.4% during 1Q19 and 2Q19, respectively. But that doesn\'t take away much from the efforts of the operators who continued to add more servers and networking related equipment in their data centers to keep up with the demand of remote access to cloud-based tools and services. New data center construction, though, did not contribute much to Capex growth in the first half of the year. The strong uptick in the latest quarter also aided in Capex growth on an annualized basis, posting an overall increase of 9% in 2Q20. Annualized Capex reached an all-time high in 2Q20, hitting $114.4 billion; the previous high was $113.1B in 4Q18. One positive was the increased spending by China-based WNOs such as Alibaba and Tencent, who are caught in the midst of the US-China trade headwinds and restrictions. Both these operators have pledged to invest billions of dollars in next-generation mega data centers, semiconductors, servers, and related technologies. Some of those investments reflected in the latest quarter, boosting single quarter Capex for China-based WNOs by 88% YoY in 2Q20. Growth in R&D investments, though, slowed down to post 12.3% YoY growth in 2Q20 (vs. 15.1% in 1Q20), and unlike Capex growth, it failed to track near pre-COVID levels (18.6% YoY growth in 4Q19). On an annualized basis, these investments clocked 16.0% YoY growth to post $164.8B for the 12 months ended June 2020. This is important because overall, WNOs spend more on R&D than Capex - as a percentage of revenues, annualized R&D/revenues were 10.7% in 2Q20 vs. 7.4% annualized Capex/revenues. Despite this, the long-term growth story for the webscale sector looks intact. The sector\'s cash & short-term investments growth also remained steady throughout the COVID crisis, logging 10.8% YoY growth in 2Q20, the same growth rate as 1Q20. Spending and investment trends by key operators A sub-group of important WNOs, the Top 8, continues to be important for tracking the sector. This group includes Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Facebook, Microsoft, and Tencent. Four of these accounted for at least 10% of total WNO Capex in the twelve-month period ending June 2020 - all based in the US: Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. Half of the Top 8 WNOs - Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, and Baidu - spent less on Capex in 2Q20 than in 2Q19. For eCommerce-based WNOs such as Amazon (109% YoY growth in Capex), Alibaba (102%), and JD.com (87%), Capex growth has been a reaction to the COVID-19 situation - their spending focused on fulfillment centers and supporting technology, but also targeted cloud operations, for Amazon and Alibaba in particular. Capex-related developments for select WNOs are summarized below: Alibaba: announced plans for US$28B of investments over several years for building data centers, chips, and servers Alphabet/Google: the company plans to recalibrate\' data center spend and freeze hiring new staff due to COVID-19 Microsoft: expects healthy Capex in 3Q20 to meet the surge in demand across its cloud-based tools and platforms Facebook: halted two data center projects (Alabama in United States, and Ireland) in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Data center construction in New Albany halted in August 2020. US$800M data center coming up in Gallatin, Tennessee Tencent: announced plans for US$70B spending over the next five years to build new data centers and infrastructure to boost its cloud computing capabilities With respect to R&D spending, webscale operators continued spending more on R&D than Capex; annualized R&D/revenues were 10.7% in 2Q20, ahead of the Capex/revenues ratio of 7.4%. Webscale operators are plowing R&D funds into a broad range of tech projects, in both predictable areas like artificial intelligence and IoT, and less obvious areas like healthcare (Amazon and Google), food delivery (Alibaba), and connected cars/self-driving (Baidu). Many webscale operators are designing their own chips now, in potential competition with current suppliers; the publisher\'s Webscale Playbook series details these efforts. M&A activity in the sector posted a strong performance in the twelve-months ending 2Q20, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and HPE each recording sizable MA costs. However, IBM\'s $34B acquisition of Red Hat stole the show during the twelve-month period. Webscale operators are also beginning to more actively partner with telcos on network projects, with Facebook\'s $5.7B splash on a stake purchase in Jio Platforms. Microsoft is also leading the way with recent big wins at AT&T and Jio in India. IBM, already a big supplier in the telco segment, will use its Red Hat acquisition to further these aspirations. Going forward, spending growth will be tested by demand volatility and supply chain constraints The current pandemic situation has somewhat proved to be a silver lining for large WNOs with strong and sizeable cloud businesses and offerings, as lockdown measures across major economies have resulted in a spike of remote access to cloud-based tools and services. However, they are also faced with two key obstacles: Slowdown in enterprise spending: New enterprise customers are hard to come by, given the spending cutbacks amid the pandemic situation. Amazon\'s CFO, Brian Olsavsky, already acknowledged this during the recent analyst call when asked about AWS\' slowing growth. Supply chain headwinds: With COVID cases continuing to rise in major economies, lack of high-technology components for network infrastructure along with delayed shipments have caused disruption to the supply chains worldwide. From the operators\' point of view, WNOs with significant dependence on non-cloud\' businesses and relatively smaller players will likely restrict their spend on webscale buildouts/data centers in 2H20 - as seen with Apple and Facebook. They must prepare to counter the effects of supply chain and workforce disruptions until the pandemic subsides considerably. While both the quarters in the first half of the year saw Capex growth surging above 20% YoY, overall, it is unlikely to sustain into the rest of the year and is expected to be in the 8-15% range. The 2Q20 WNO Market Review analyzes the network infrastructure spending and financial position of webscale network operators (WNOs). WNOs are web-centric companies who own and operate large multi-country communications networks based upon hyperscale data centers and submarine cables. Webscale operators may also own access networks, typically using fixed satellite or fiber. WNOs own network assets in order to support their core businesses, which comprise digital advertising, online retail, cloud, digital media and content services, and other digital-based services. The webscale segment excludes companies with digital business models who rely primarily on rented cloud capacity or collocation space. Twitter, for instance, is not a webscale operator, as its network relies on a mix of rented space in carrier-neutral data centers and rented cloud resources from Google. By contrast, Apple is webscale; although it has partnerships with GCP and AWS for cloud capacity, Apple owns several large data centers, and is building more. WNOs tracked in this report include the Top 8 companies (Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Facebook, Microsoft, and Tencent) and 12 others: Altaba, ChinaCache, Cognizant, eBay, Fujitsu, HPE, IBM, JD.COM, LinkedIn, Oracle, SAP, and Yandex.

Continue Reading Beowulf Offers New Innovative Business Model for Its Services Since its inception, Beowulf has rapidly become a recognized international leader for innovation in video conferencing, especially for education and large-scale conference halls with best-in-breed video call quality. Beowulf provides unparalleled accessibility, such as ""plug and play"" simplicity, one-click connectivity, and the innovative QR code scan-to-call technology. Services like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams require monthly or annual payments for their services, which can pose challenges to many businesses across the world, due to international payments. With Beowulf\'s business model, this roadblock has been inherently removed. By replacing the monthly payments with the holdings of BWF coins, users can now enjoy free services across Beowulf\'s offerings, and subsequently avoid the administrative complexities of managing multiple subscription plans. Additionally, with this approach, the users\' holdings of BWF can appreciate over time, thus gaining value instead of losing it completely in the service pricing model. For example, individuals or entities that hold at least 5,000 BWF coins in their account will have access to the Beowulf platform free of charge. This replaces QUICKOM\'s $11 monthly subscription fee and grants the unlimited hosting of up to 100 users for online conferences and remote teaching.""As the user base for our products grows exponentially, we are connecting our suite of products through the holdings of BWF coin. Through co-ownership of the blockchain, users are now empowered more than ever to access our all-encompassing Beowulf technology suite, free of charge, and in the true spirit of a decentralized model,"" Dr. William H. Nguyen stated.Among its many services, QUICKOMby Beowulf is well-positioned to become the next-generation video conferencing platform, enabling users to host, participate and enjoy unmatched collaboration. The platform brings remote participants together as if they were physically in the same room, thus efficiently taking the \'distance\' out of \'distance classroom\' or \'distance conference\'. With the hosting capacity for up to 5,000 participants, QUICKOM fulfills a complete suite of large-scale conferencing needs, as well as remote training and teaching activities.Beowulf\'s various business partnerships are an apt demonstration of the platform\'s growing popularity, as it has amassed thousands of world-leading customers and partners, serving millions of users.

The expansion comes from internal resources, as they are promoted into new, focused roles aimed at leveraging their skills sets to enhance Tigunia\'s business objectives. The first of these promotions is Ron Summers, who moves from Vice President of Business Intelligence to President at Tiguina, after only one year in his previous role and one year total at the company. ""This is an exciting time to be advancing my career,"" says Summers. ""The business world is rapidly changing as we respond to the ongoing pressures of technology advances coupled with the response to the pandemic. We are working to balance new offers and solutions for our current and future clients with the care and understanding of how their businesses are changing. This is an opportunity for Tigunia to take more of what we know about working in remote or virtual environments and present the technology supports that businesses need. I look forward to challenging our executive team to think critically and innovatively to become increasingly proactive at solving business problems with technology. "" Filling Summers\'s place is Ryan Paterson, who expands his role as Director of Business Intelligence to include significant new duties. ""When I joined Tigunia in 2019, I knew there were some significant growth goals on the horizon. As things changed with the pandemic, we never lost sight of that,"" says Paterson. ""I truly believe that data and business intelligence are powerful tools for businesses, and that hasn\'t changed. It\'s my goal to bring more innovation to the BI teams\' offerings and find new and valuable ways to help businesses continue to grow despite global pressures. With proper insight into business and operations, decision-makers can be more confident and fluid in their planning and be more prepared to adjust operational levers as required, long before the business struggles to adapt or make changes. That\'s what Tigunia is the most focused on helping our customers find the right fit technology today and in the future."" Also, moving from the role of Senior Solutions Architect, which he has held for three years with Tigunia, Kristoffer Ruyeras moves into the position of Vice President of Operations. This new role will allow Bret Weber, owner and Chief Operating Officer at Tigunia, to focus on other parts of running the business while enabling Ruyeras to take more control over the daily operations. ""We are a growing company, and with growth comes complexity,"" says Ruyeras. ""I have been a part of the team for several years now, and I have a lot of ideas and motivation to help us continue to thrive, despite the ongoing challenges all businesses are currently facing. By moving into the VP of Operations role, I can help formalize the operational processes and allow the owners of the company to put more time into strategizing and planning our next several years. I believe my combination of development and solution architecture skills and my management style will be key to developing our team."" Tigunia\'s final new addition to the executive team comes with Justin Verette, who will move from his role as Business Technology Advisor, which he held for the previous 15 months, into the role of VP, App Development. ""This is a newly created role at Tigunia and one that comes at an excellent time in our growth,"" says Verette. ""We\'ve been developing apps in this space for several years, but with the continued proliferation of the cloud and new niche requirements for our customers coming every day, it\'s important that we have the ability to quickly respond. My goal is to ensure our application development team is focused on solving the most pressing challenges and delivering high quality technology that is the right fit for every client."" Both Bret Weber and Marc Stocker, who founded and co-own Tigunia, have spent a significant portion of the last 18 months planning for the strategic growth and development of the company. While they shifted focus at the start of the year to drive more services and solutions for customers affected by the pandemic, they remained dedicated to building the executive team as a means to keep building the company. Tigunia plans to continue developing and launching new technology solutions to keep pace with the current SMB market.

Interoperability has become a critical consideration for all health IT applications. Globally, major healthcare stakeholders acknowledge the need to invest in digital infrastructure capabilities that facilitate cross-continuum patient information exchange and support evidence-based care, at scale.Regulatory agencies are also embracing forward-thinking policies that advocate the need for major health IT vendors to become fully interoperable with each other. The objective is to drive a progressive digital healthcare approach, one that is standardized, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary, yet modular and API based.Not everyone, however, is technically mature to make that approach a reality. Market-leading companies (HIT vendors and hospitals) in the US are expected to not comply with CMS\' 21st Century Cures Act, which provisions for safe and secure transfer of patient data across the care continuum, because of threats that range from breach of patient privacy to the overwhelming cost of commitment and significant penalties. Countries, where HIT interoperability standards are equally important and regulated, are projected to drive the market along with the US, driven by the entry of enterprise ICT companies (Apple, Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle) that promise to improve patient data accessibility across the globe on behalf of major payers, providers, and government agencies.In the future, data interoperability between revenue cycle management (RCM), Electronic Medical Record (EMR), wearables, imaging, and supply chain IT solutions will mark a new era of holistic population health management. As a result, the population health management market, coupled with the social determinant of the health market, will continue to drive global market revenue in favor of healthcare interoperability solutions. Additionally, quality performance management during and post-care will be the most important investment area for payers, providers, and government agencies. Data analytics and data interoperability solutions will be mainly utilized for purposes that serve the broader objective of value-based care, which is to report quality outcomes across the care continuum near real-time. More importantly, the healthcare interoperability market will be primarily driven in the future by progressive healthcare stakeholders that are currently harnessing the power of AI technologies to support interdisciplinary treatment decisions across multiple disparate healthcare departments across the care continuum.Key Topics Covered: Executive Summary Key Findings - Global Market Forces Key Findings - Global Market Financials Key Findings - Select Vendor Examples Scope and Segmentation Key Questions this Study will Answer Market Engineering Measurements CEOs Perspective Executive Summary - 3 Big Predictions Market Overview Growth Opportunities Resulting from Broader Industry Convergence Introduction Market Segmentation Market Distribution Channels Market Distribution Channels Discussion Drivers and Restraints Impact of Healthcare Industry Mega Trends on the Digital Health Interoperability Market Mega Trend Impact on the Interoperability Market Market Drivers Market Restraints Revenue Forecasts and Trends - Total Healthcare Interoperability Market Forecast Assumptions and Definitions Market Engineering Measurements Revenue Forecast Revenue Forecast Discussion Percent Revenue Forecast by Region Segment Lifecycle Analysis Market Engineering Measurements Latin American Region Key Findings Revenue Forecast by Product Segment Revenue Discussion by Product Segment Penetration Analysis - Global Outlook Competitive Environment - Total Healthcare Interoperability Market Market Share Changes in the Competitive Environment Competitive Environment Competitive Market Structure Detailed Vendor Landscape Segmentation Growth Opportunity Assessment 5 Major Growth Opportunities Strategic Imperatives for Success and Growth Appendix - Demographic Indicators: Selected Nations US Healthcare - Demographic Indicators Chinese Healthcare - Demographic Indicators Japanese Healthcare - Demographic Indicators Indian Healthcare - Demographic Indicators UAE Healthcare - Demographic Indicators UK Healthcare - Demographic Indicators For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/8oe0qi Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.

Business Outlook The following statements are based on the Company\'s current expectations, and many of these statements are forward-looking. Actual results are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from the Company\'s expectations. Please refer to the Forward Looking Statements Safe Harbor section of this press release below. The following represents the expected range of financial results for the fiscal third quarter of 2021 (all amounts assume currency rates remain stable): Q3 FY21 Guidance GAAP Net Revenue $417M - $447M Non-GAAP Revenue $420M - $450M Adjusted EBITDA1 $70M - $80M Non-GAAP Diluted EPS1,2 $0.85 - $1.05 1 Q3 Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance excludes estimated intangibles amortization expense of $30.7 million. With respect to adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS guidance, the Company has determined that it is unable to provide quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures with a reasonable degree of confidence in their accuracy without unreasonable effort, as items including stock based compensation, litigation gains and losses, and impacts from discrete tax adjustments and tax laws are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the Company\'s control. 2 EPS guidance assumes approximately 42 million diluted average weighted shares and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 11% to 13%. Conference Call and Earnings Presentation Poly is providing an earnings presentation in combination with this press release. The presentation is offered to provide shareholders and analysts with additional detail for analyzing results. The presentation will be available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at investor.poly.com along with this press release. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided at the end of this press release. We have scheduled a webcast to discuss second quarter fiscal year 2021 financial results. The webcast will take place today, October29, 2020, at 2:00 PM (Pacific Time). All interested investors and potential investors in Poly stock are invited to join. To listen to the webcast, please access the webcast link from our Investor Relations website at investor.poly.com. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after its conclusion and can be accessed from our Investor Relations website at investor.poly.com. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of operating results, including non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP diluted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to exclude, or include where applicable, the effect of purchase accounting on deferred revenue, charges associated with the optimization of our Consumer product line, stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses, purchase accounting amortization and adjustments, restructuring and other related charges and credits, impairment charges, rebranding costs, other unusual and/or non-cash charges and credits, and the impact of participating securities, all net of any associated tax impact. We also exclude tax benefits from the release of tax reserves, discrete tax adjustments including transfer pricing, tax deduction and tax credit adjustments, and the impact of tax law changes. We adjust these amounts from our non-GAAP measures primarily because management does not believe they are consistent with the development of our target operating model. We believe that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity and helps investors compare actual results with our historical and long-term target operating model goals as well as our performance as a combined company. We believe presenting non-GAAP net revenue provides meaningful supplemental information regarding how management views the performance of the business and underlying performance of our individual product categories. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods; however, non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, or superior to, net revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. Forward Looking Statements Safe Harbor This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements relating to our intentions, beliefs, projections, outlook, analyses or current expectations that are subject to many risks and uncertainties.

(b) our inability to source component parts from key suppliers in sufficient quantities necessary to meet the high demand for certain product lines, including our Enterprise Headsets; and continued uncertainty and potential impact on future quarters if these sourcing constraints continue and/or price volatility occurs,which could continue to negatively affect our profitability and/or market share; (c) expectations related to our voice product lines, as well as our services attachment rate for such products, which have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted as companies have delayed returning their workforces to offices in many countries due to the continued impact of COVID-19;

(f) the impact if global or regional economic conditions deteriorate further, on our customers and/or partners, including increased demand for pricing accommodations, delayed payments, delayed deployment plans, insolvency or other issues which may increase credit losses; (g) risks related to restrictions or delays in global return to worksites as a result of COVID-19, which continues to impact our employees worldwide and our customers, which has negatively impacted our voice product lines for the quarter, and restricted customer engagement; and (h) the complexity of the forecast analysis and the design and operation of internal controls; and (ii) our belief that we can manufacture or supply products in a timely manner to satisfy perishable demand; (iii) expectations related to our customers\' purchasing decisions and our ability to pivot quickly enough and/or match product production to demand, particularly given long lead times and the difficulty of forecasting unit volumes and acquiring the component parts and materials to meet demand without having excess inventory or incurring cancellation charges; (iv) risks associated with significant and abrupt changes in product demand which increases the complexity of management\'s evaluation of potential excess or obsolete inventory; (v) risks associated with the bankruptcy or financial weakness of distributors or key customers, or the bankruptcy of or reduction in capacity of our key suppliers; (vi) risks associated with the potential interruption in the supply of sole-sourced critical components, our ability to move to a dual-source model, and the continuity of component supply at costs consistent with our plans, which has negatively impacted in the quarter and may continue to impact our ability to timely supply product to meet our customer demand; (vii) expectations related to our services segment revenues, particularly as we introduce new generation, less complex, product solutions, or as companies shift from on premises to work from home options for their workforce, which may result in decreased demand forour professional, installation and/or managed service offerings; (viii) expectations that our current cash on hand, additional cash generated from operations, together with sources of cash through our credit facility, either alone or in combination with our election to suspend our dividend payments, will meet our liquidity needs during and following the unknown duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; (ix) expectations relating to our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt covenants and timely repay all principal and interest amounts drawn under our credit facility as they become due; (x) risks associated with our channel partners\' sales reporting, product inventories and product sell through since we sell a significant amount of products to channel partners who maintain their own inventory of our products; (xi) our efforts to execute to drive sales and sustainable profitable revenue growth, to improve our profitability and cash flow, and accelerate debt reduction and de-levering; (xii) our expectations for new products launches, the timing of their releases and their expected impact on future growth and on our existing products; (xiii) our belief that our Partner Program will drive growth and profitability for both us and our partners through the sale of our product, services and solutions; (xiv) risks associated with forecasting sales and procurement demands, which are inherently difficult, particularly with continuing uncertainty in regional and global economic conditions; (xv) uncertainties attributable to currency fluctuations, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and/or new or greater tariffs on our products; (xvi) our expectations regarding our ability to control costs, streamline operations and successfully implement our various cost-reduction activities and realize anticipated cost savings under such cost-reduction initiatives; (xvii) expectations relating to our quarterly and annual earnings guidance, particularly as economic uncertainty, including, without limitation, uncertainty related to the continued impact of COVID-19, the macro-economic and political climate and other external factors, puts further pressure on management judgments used to develop forward looking financial guidance and other prospective financial information;

The United States Managed Service Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% during the forecast period 2020-2025.The US managed service market is growing due to the changing landscape of IT infrastructure, especially in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), who are continually focusing on outsourcing cybersecurity solutions. It is estimated that successful deployment of managed services will help in reducing IT cost by 25%-45%, and it will increase operational efficiency by 45%-65%. For instance, Kpaul Properties LLC, one of the emerging manufacturers and distributors of IT supplies in the United States, onboarded FUJITSU to replace physical servers with a virtualized environment. This has reduced the company\'s cost by 15% and delivered 95% uptime. The country is also suffering from ransomware attacks, where lately, 20 Texas towns faced cybersecurity incidents. To address these gaps in cyber defenses, Atos was selected by the Virginia Information Technology Agency to introduce advanced prescriptive cybersecurity services for the agency. US businesses are more likely to increase spending to upgrade outdated infrastructure. For instance, following a double-digit reduction in the US tax burden on business profits in 2018, only 4% of North American businesses said they plan to increase IT spending in 2020, due to corporate tax cuts (Spiceworks, 2019). During the spread of Covid-19 pandemic overall managed services are expected to decline moderately, managed cloud services (MCS) are still a potential bright spot. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) services are among the few technologies for which IT spending is likely to remain relatively resilient. The demand for managed communication services has also increased. Given the considerable shift in consumption demands for content, gaming, and communication, CSPs have introduced affordable, uncapped data plans with delayed payment options. Key Market TrendsManaged Network Segment is Expected to Grow SignificantlyManaged Network Services (MNS) are a class of Managed Service that facilitates businesses to outsource the management of their customer premise equipment (CPE), and networks, such as switches, routers, access points, firewalls, and more. Also, in the North American region, the US dominates the regional 5G market owing to a high rate of investment for 5G deployment., regarding investment, adoption, and applications. The end-user industry in the country accounts for the significant portion of the global consumption of 5G technology. This is expected to enable MSPs to improve network design, optimization, and management and play a significant part in rolling out 5G services especially for tier 2 and tier 3 carriers. In most cases, Managed Service Providers (MSP) promote multi-vendor environments giving customers the flexibility to choose their favored vendors for network devices. MSP\'s proactively monitor the security, health, and performance of the network infrastructure, while implementing incident management and problem resolution and thereby helping to evade network downtime. Some MSP\'s even incorporate options such as quality assurance reviews, hardware support, and reporting, or an online portal where customers can announce issues or request changes to their service. The increasing number of cyberattacks are on a rise and therefore the demand for network security service has also grown. For instance, the total number of cybersecurity incidents reported by federal agencies in the United States has drastically increased from 5,503 in 2006, to 35,277 in 2017. In 2018, the United States business sector recorded the highest number of data breaches ever. Amongst all the sectors affected by these attacks, about 45.7% of total data breach incidents reported in the country were targeted towards business institutions followed by the medical/healthcare sector at 29.3% and the Banking/Credit/Financial sector at 9.8%. Therefore as the businesses grow in terms of complexity due to globalization, BYOD trend and rise of connected devices along with incredible amount of data generated every day, the demand for managed network services are expected to proliferate during the forecast period. BFSI to Witness Significant GrowthFor banks and financial institutions, data centers have become the most critical part of their IT infrastructure and need efficient management and monitoring. Managed services for banks include monitoring, administration, and management of various servers, storage, backup, databases, and network devices. Furthermore, they also offer a multi-level security framework for their data centers to ensure the uptime of this critical infrastructure. Banks have been forging partnerships with companies, to incorporate trends, like IoT, into the banking structure and keep pace with continuously evolving technology and consumer expectations, comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards and deliver the reliability, security, speed, and efficiency that account holders demand. For instance, In November 2019, Bank of America and IBM, along with IBM\'s regulatory compliance arm Promontory Financial Group, have partnered to build a cloud for banks that has security, privacy, and bank-specific regulatory compliance built-in. A wave of data privacy regulations in North America seems likely after the California Consumer Privacy Act. Meeting the demands of regulatory compliance is linked closely with extra efforts in terms of time, workforce, and cost to banking and financial firms. According to Citigroup, the cost is USD 270 billion annually, 10% of the operating cost across the banking industry. For this, banks need to integrate business processes with advanced analytical capabilities, driving continuous improvements to processes, services, and products in real-time. Therefore, Banks and other financial institutions are increasingly approaching managed service providers to address these challenges and to enable them to shift the focus and skills on activities of the most value to their business. Competitive LandscapeThe United States managed services market is consolidated, and it is dominated by major players. Some of the major players in the market are Cisco Systems Inc., IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Fujitsu Ltd, and Wipro Ltd, among others.In March 2020, Infosys and IBM announced a partnership to help business enterprises accelerate their digital transformation activity using the IBM cloud services. This collaboration may help the enterprises transition, modernize, and transform their workflows and applications with IBM cloud services. This may help the enterprises that are operating in highly regulated industries, like BFSI, healthcare, and other industries.Key Topics Covered: 1 INTRODUCTION2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.3 Industry Attractiveness - Porter\'s Five Forces Analysis4.4 Market Drivers4.4.1 Increasing Shift to Hybrid IT4.4.2 Improved Cost and Operational Efficiency4.5 Market Challenges4.6 Assessment of Impact of Covid-19 on the Industry 5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Deployment5.1.1 On-premise5.1.2 Cloud (Trends pertaining to initiatives taken by MSPs to include PaaS as part of their offerings, along with partnership with leading PaaS providers, will be covered)5.2 By Type5.2.1 Managed Data Center5.2.2 Managed Security5.2.3 Managed Communications5.2.4 Managed Network5.2.5 Managed Infrastructure5.2.6 Managed Mobility5.3 By Organization Size5.3.1 Small and Medium Enterprises5.3.2 Large Enterprises5.4 By End user Industry5.4.1 BFSI5.4.2 IT and Telecom5.4.3 Healthcare5.4.4 Entertainment and Media5.4.5 Retail5.4.6 Manufacturing5.4.7 Government5.4.8 Other End-user Industries5.5 Geography6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 Fujitsu Ltd6.1.2 Cisco Systems Inc.6.1.3 IBM Corporation6.1.4 AT&T Inc.6.1.5 HP Development Company LP6.1.6 Microsoft Corporation6.1.7 Verizon Communications Inc.6.1.8 Dell Technologies Inc.6.1.9 Nokia Solutions and Networks6.1.10 Deutsche Telekom AG6.1.11 Rackspace Inc.6.1.12 Tata Consultancy Services Limited6.1.13 Citrix Systems Inc.6.1.14 Wipro Ltd6.1.15 NSC Global Ltd 7 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS 8 FUTURE OF THE MARKETFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/89k9zc Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.

With respect to adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS guidance, the Company has determined that it is unable to provide quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures with a reasonable degree of confidence in their accuracy without unreasonable effort, as items including stock based compensation, litigation gains and losses, and impacts from discrete tax adjustments and tax laws are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the Company\'s control. 2 EPS guidance assumes approximately 42 million diluted average weighted shares and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 11% to 13%.

The presentation is offered to provide shareholders and analysts with additional detail for analyzing results.

A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after its conclusion and can be accessed from our Investor Relations website at investor.poly.com. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of operating results, including non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP diluted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to exclude, or include where applicable, the effect of purchase accounting on deferred revenue, charges associated with the optimization of our Consumer product line, stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses, purchase accounting amortization and adjustments, restructuring and other related charges and credits, impairment charges, rebranding costs, other unusual and/or non-cash charges and credits, and the impact of participating securities, all net of any associated tax impact. We also exclude tax benefits from the release of tax reserves, discrete tax adjustments including transfer pricing, tax deduction and tax credit adjustments, and the impact of tax law changes. We adjust these amounts from our non-GAAP measures primarily because management does not believe they are consistent with the development of our target operating model. We believe that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity and helps investors compare actual results with our historical and long-term target operating model goals as well as our performance as a combined company. We believe presenting non-GAAP net revenue provides meaningful supplemental information regarding how management views the performance of the business and underlying performance of our individual product categories. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods; however, non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, or superior to, net revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(Spectra7 or the Company), a leading provider of high-performance analog semiconductor products for broadband connectivity markets, today announced three new reference designs targeted at new server connectivity needs implementing 56Gbps PAM4 signaling on Ethernet Network Interface Cards (NICs). The leading suppliers of these cards, Nvidia, Broadcom and Intel, are all gearing up to release new products using this higher speed signaling. The data center Ethernet NIC market revenue is set to grow 28 percent in 2020 with growth accelerating through 2024, driven by server shipments and the adoption of higher speed offload and programmable NICs. This market is poised to hit $4.5 billion by 2024.1 With virtualization, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning driving up server workloads, the network connection is becoming a bandwidth bottleneck. These NICs are used in servers by Hyperscalers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Tencent, and Alibaba. As servers adopt higher bandwidth ports that utilize 56Gbps PAM4 signaling, passive cables cannot serve all lengths needed. Instead of deploying optical interconnects that are much higher power and more costly, operators are looking to Active Copper Cables (ACCs) to serve this growing need. One example is Tencent who demonstrated a Spectra7 enabled ACC for server connectivity in September at Chinas Open Data Center Committee (ODCC) conference. The 200Gbps demonstration showed a Spectra7 enabled ACC splitter cable connecting from a 200Gbps top-of-rack (ToR) switch port to 2 separate servers with 100Gbps NIC ports. The signaling in the cable was 56Gbps PAM4. This splitter cable architecture is being widely planned both in the US and in China for next generation deployments. Spectra7 is announcing immediate availability of three reference designs to support this critical need. All designs utilize Spectra7s Dual Channel 56Gbps PAM4 technology. GCS-QSFP Reference Design Server Connectivity Splitter Cable with 200Gbps QSFP56-CR4 form factor module at switch end and 2 QSFP56-CR2 form factor modules at server ends. A total of 4 GC2502 ICs are used in this reference design. GCS-DSFP Reference Design Server Connectivity Splitter Cable with 200Gbps QSFP56-CR4 form factor module at switch end and 2 DSFP-CR2 form factor modules at server ends. A total of 4 GC2502 ICs are used in this reference design. GCS-SFP-DD Reference Design Server Connectivity Splitter Cable with 200Gbps QSFP56-CR4 form factor module at switch end and 2 SFP-DD-CR2 form factor modules at server ends. A total of 4 GC2502 ICs are used in this reference design. We are thrilled that Hyperscalers are expanding their use of Spectra7 technology for use in 56Gbps server connectivity, said Spectra7 CEO Raouf Halim. This represents a significant increase in the market opportunity for our GC2502 data center solution. These new reference designs will enable our cable partners to quickly respond to these this new server connectivity requirements. GaugeChanger is an innovative and disruptive technology that allows copper to extend much longer lengths without the cost and power penalty of optics. It works equally well at 25Gbps NRZ and 50Gbps PAM4 enabling new connector standards of 100, 200 and 400Gbps. ABOUT SPECTRA7 MICROSYSTEMS INC.

(Spectra7 or the Company), a leading provider of high-performance analog semiconductor products for broadband connectivity markets, today announced three new reference designs targeted at new server connectivity needs implementing 56Gbps PAM4 signaling on Ethernet Network Interface Cards (NICs). The leading suppliers of these cards, Nvidia, Broadcom and Intel, are all gearing up to release new products using this higher speed signaling. The data center Ethernet NIC market revenue is set to grow 28 percent in 2020 with growth accelerating through 2024, driven by server shipments and the adoption of higher speed offload and programmable NICs. This market is poised to hit $4.5 billion by 2024.1 With virtualization, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning driving up server workloads, the network connection is becoming a bandwidth bottleneck. These NICs are used in servers by Hyperscalers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Tencent, and Alibaba. As servers adopt higher bandwidth ports that utilize 56Gbps PAM4 signaling, passive cables cannot serve all lengths needed. Instead of deploying optical interconnects that are much higher power and more costly, operators are looking to Active Copper Cables (ACCs) to serve this growing need. One example is Tencent who demonstrated a Spectra7 enabled ACC for server connectivity in September at Chinas Open Data Center Committee (ODCC) conference. The 200Gbps demonstration showed a Spectra7 enabled ACC splitter cable connecting from a 200Gbps top-of-rack (ToR) switch port to 2 separate servers with 100Gbps NIC ports. The signaling in the cable was 56Gbps PAM4. This splitter cable architecture is being widely planned both in the US and in China for next generation deployments. Spectra7 is announcing immediate availability of three reference designs to support this critical need. All designs utilize Spectra7s Dual Channel 56Gbps PAM4 technology. GCS-QSFP Reference Design Server Connectivity Splitter Cable with 200Gbps QSFP56-CR4 form factor module at switch end and 2 QSFP56-CR2 form factor modules at server ends. A total of 4 GC2502 ICs are used in this reference design. GCS-DSFP Reference Design Server Connectivity Splitter Cable with 200Gbps QSFP56-CR4 form factor module at switch end and 2 DSFP-CR2 form factor modules at server ends. A total of 4 GC2502 ICs are used in this reference design. GCS-SFP-DD Reference Design Server Connectivity Splitter Cable with 200Gbps QSFP56-CR4 form factor module at switch end and 2 SFP-DD-CR2 form factor modules at server ends. A total of 4 GC2502 ICs are used in this reference design. We are thrilled that Hyperscalers are expanding their use of Spectra7 technology for use in 56Gbps server connectivity, said Spectra7 CEO Raouf Halim. This represents a significant increase in the market opportunity for our GC2502 data center solution. These new reference designs will enable our cable partners to quickly respond to these this new server connectivity requirements. GaugeChanger is an innovative and disruptive technology that allows copper to extend much longer lengths without the cost and power penalty of optics. It works equally well at 25Gbps NRZ and 50Gbps PAM4 enabling new connector standards of 100, 200 and 400Gbps. ABOUT SPECTRA7 MICROSYSTEMS INC.

New cloud implementations and go-lives for the quarter included Arlington, VA; Baltimore County, MD; Charlotte, NC; Denver Fire Department; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Milwaukee, WI; Rochester, MN; San Diego, CA; Shelby County, TN; Wine Australia, and Abu Dhabi Department of Health. This past quarter, Accelarolled out its new Premium Citizen Experience powered by OpenCities designed to give governments a no-code way to create an intuitive digital front door for vital citizen services, announced new strategic partnership with Forte Payment Systems to provide a powerful digital payments processing engine for Accela\'s cloud solutions, and successfully migrated over 200 customers from their on-premise solutions to its SaaS infrastructure powered by Azure. Accela also received awards from Microsoft, SaaS Mag, and the San Francisco Business Times, underscoring its status as a market leader in helping governments of all sizes adapt to a rapidly-changing civic landscape. ""At Accela, our mission is to help our state and local customers better serve their communities through innovative SaaS technology. Residents and businesses are depending on government leaders now more than ever, and supporting those agencies in putting community outcomes first is all we do,"" said Gary Kovacs, CEO of Accela. ""2020 has shown us the power of bringing people and technology together to solve some of the greatest civic challenges we face. As we approach the end of a transformative year, I could not be more proud of the incredible progress we\'ve made that has demonstrated increasing demand for Accela\'s market leading technology and expertise."" Partnerships to Reimagine Government In September, Accela also announced its new Premium Citizen Experience powered by OpenCities to redefine the modern relationship between citizen and government. This new offering helps agencies build engaging, easy-to-use websites and online forms that connect residents and businesses with licensing, permitting, service request, and other functions. Beyond facilitating transactions, these sites act as agency and jurisdiction ""front doors"" enabling information sharing, transparency by putting the citizen experience first. Using the solution, governments of all sizes can create modern, intuitive, and ""consumer-like"" experiences without the need for custom coding, outside vendors, or contractors to maintain digital services, saving valuable time and resources amid widespread government budget cuts. ""As technology evolves, the standard for agencies to exceed citizen expectations and not just deliver on \'government as usual\' continues to increase,"" said Kevin Goodwin, Chief Technology Officer of the City of San Antonio. ""With people now increasingly relying on virtual forms of connection with their governments, user-centric design is imperative to effectively provide critical services and build trust with citizens. Having easy-to-use solutions built with the user in mind that can be implemented quickly has enabled San Antonio to consistently put the needs of our community first and deliver greater results."" In keeping with a deep focus on creating consumer-like experiences for government customers, Accela also announced a strategic partnership with flexible payment solutions provider Forte Payment Systems to provide a powerful payments processing engine for Accela\'s SaaS solutions. As work-from-home mandates for citizen and agency employees have complicated team workflows for accepting paper or in-person payments, online transactions have become an absolute requirement. The partnership will empower government agencies to refine cumbersome manual processes for evolving regulatory and business procedures. Agencies leveraging this integration will gain value from Forte\'s capabilities as both a payment processor and gateway for 90 percent of online payment processors. Additionally, Accela and Australia-based strategic partner DWS partnered to help Wine Australia, which regulates Australia\'s AUD2.84 billion wine export sector, launch a SaaS licensing and approval system powered by Accela technology. The new system is projected to process more than 200,000 transactions from more than 3,000 wine exporters from around Australia each year. The system provides end-to-end processing and allows exporters to apply online for licenses and certificates, with greater control of their applications, including review and payment online in real-time and with 24/7 access. Transforming State and Local Response to COVID-19 Since the launch of its COVID-19 Response Solutions earlier this year, Accela has continued to partner with cities, counties, and states across the country as they navigate evolving citizen, financial, and technological needs in the face of the pandemic. These solutions were developed in response to accelerated customer demand for digital service capability to tackle the challenges of the pandemic and include support for remote workers, online citizen services, virtual inspections, managing the process of re-opening businesses, and more. In July, the COVID-19 Response Solutions received a 2020 Microsoft US Partner Award for ""Community Response,"" recognizing Accela\'s innovation in empowering state and local governments to respond to increasingly challenging external events by transitioning critical citizen services online. By leveraging Accela to provide digital services prior to the pandemic, Charlotte, North Carolina was able to continue business as usual amidst the new work-from-home paradigm. The fastest-growing metropolitan area in the nation, Charlotte, North Carolina, needed to improve customer experience and quickly overcome the physical challenges presented by COVID-19. With the help of Accela, Charlotte had moved its entire planning process online in 2008, which enabled a seamless transition into remote work for office staff when ""shelter-in-place"" orders went into effect. By offering digital citizen services, the city could continue providing quality service to citizens remotely during a time when traditional methods would have been impeded or stopped project owners in their tracks. ""The City, being an early adopter of Accela, and using the product, has made what could have been a horrible experience almost seamless,"" said Nan Peterson, Business Relationship Manager, for the City of Charlotte. ""We basically walked out the door that Tuesday night, and by Wednesday people were back to work at their home office wherever that might be, working seamlessly."" Other major company, partnership, and event milestones achieved last quarter include the following: Accela successfully completed over 200 customer migrations from Accela\'s data center-hosted solution to its SaaS infrastructure powered by Azure, completing the project in just nine months. Accela\'s open, flexible, and secure cloud solutions hosted on Azure offer agencies a wide variety of benefits by centrally hosting and maintaining all infrastructure and application software. These include increased agility to navigate the shifting civic landscape, radically decreased deployment time, financial predictability, and more. The shift improves Accela\'s ability to continuously ramp capacity to meet the influx of demand for its cloud offering. Further, it enables Accela to take advantage of Microsoft\'s growing suite of Azure applications, increasing Accela\'s pace of innovation. SaaS Mag named Accela one of the world\'s fastest-growing SaaS companies for the second consecutive year on its SaaS 1000 list. The San Francisco Business Times named Accela among the 2020 Top 50 Largest East Bay Tech Employers. Microsoft awarded Accela in its One Commercial Partner (OCP) FY21 Q1 Winners Circle program within the category of Top IP Co-Sell ACR in the Public Sector by an ISV partner. The program rewards top managed partner performance on key Microsoft U.S. metrics from the previous quarter, effectively helping Microsoft and its partners\' customers digitally transform. To help simplify fire inspections and fuel emergency preparedness, Accela hosted a three-part webinar series hosted with Microsoft Director of Justice and Public Safety Solutions Rick Zak on how to leverage SaaS technology to build safer communities, as fire departments face rising challenges from the pandemic and peak fire season simultaneously. Accela redesigned its annual conference and training event, Accelarate, to be 100 percent virtual in 2020. This year\'s speakers included Microsoft Executive Director of State and Local Government Solutions Kim Nelson, acclaimed documentary filmmaker Brett Culp, and Accela CEO Gary Kovacs.

New cloud implementations and go-lives for the quarter included Arlington, VA; Baltimore County, MD; Charlotte, NC; Denver Fire Department; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Milwaukee, WI; Rochester, MN; San Diego, CA; Shelby County, TN; Wine Australia, and Abu Dhabi Department of Health. This past quarter, Accelarolled out its new Premium Citizen Experience powered by OpenCities designed to give governments a no-code way to create an intuitive digital front door for vital citizen services, announced new strategic partnership with Forte Payment Systems to provide a powerful digital payments processing engine for Accela\'s cloud solutions, and successfully migrated over 200 customers from their on-premise solutions to its SaaS infrastructure powered by Azure. Accela also received awards from Microsoft, SaaS Mag, and the San Francisco Business Times, underscoring its status as a market leader in helping governments of all sizes adapt to a rapidly-changing civic landscape. ""At Accela, our mission is to help our state and local customers better serve their communities through innovative SaaS technology. Residents and businesses are depending on government leaders now more than ever, and supporting those agencies in putting community outcomes first is all we do,"" said Gary Kovacs, CEO of Accela. ""2020 has shown us the power of bringing people and technology together to solve some of the greatest civic challenges we face. As we approach the end of a transformative year, I could not be more proud of the incredible progress we\'ve made that has demonstrated increasing demand for Accela\'s market leading technology and expertise."" Partnerships to Reimagine Government In September, Accela also announced its new Premium Citizen Experience powered by OpenCities to redefine the modern relationship between citizen and government. This new offering helps agencies build engaging, easy-to-use websites and online forms that connect residents and businesses with licensing, permitting, service request, and other functions. Beyond facilitating transactions, these sites act as agency and jurisdiction ""front doors"" enabling information sharing, transparency by putting the citizen experience first. Using the solution, governments of all sizes can create modern, intuitive, and ""consumer-like"" experiences without the need for custom coding, outside vendors, or contractors to maintain digital services, saving valuable time and resources amid widespread government budget cuts. ""As technology evolves, the standard for agencies to exceed citizen expectations and not just deliver on \'government as usual\' continues to increase,"" said Kevin Goodwin, Chief Technology Officer of the City of San Antonio. ""With people now increasingly relying on virtual forms of connection with their governments, user-centric design is imperative to effectively provide critical services and build trust with citizens. Having easy-to-use solutions built with the user in mind that can be implemented quickly has enabled San Antonio to consistently put the needs of our community first and deliver greater results."" In keeping with a deep focus on creating consumer-like experiences for government customers, Accela also announced a strategic partnership with flexible payment solutions provider Forte Payment Systems to provide a powerful payments processing engine for Accela\'s SaaS solutions. As work-from-home mandates for citizen and agency employees have complicated team workflows for accepting paper or in-person payments, online transactions have become an absolute requirement. The partnership will empower government agencies to refine cumbersome manual processes for evolving regulatory and business procedures. Agencies leveraging this integration will gain value from Forte\'s capabilities as both a payment processor and gateway for 90 percent of online payment processors. Additionally, Accela and Australia-based strategic partner DWS partnered to help Wine Australia, which regulates Australia\'s AUD2.84 billion wine export sector, launch a SaaS licensing and approval system powered by Accela technology. The new system is projected to process more than 200,000 transactions from more than 3,000 wine exporters from around Australia each year. The system provides end-to-end processing and allows exporters to apply online for licenses and certificates, with greater control of their applications, including review and payment online in real-time and with 24/7 access. Transforming State and Local Response to COVID-19 Since the launch of its COVID-19 Response Solutions earlier this year, Accela has continued to partner with cities, counties, and states across the country as they navigate evolving citizen, financial, and technological needs in the face of the pandemic. These solutions were developed in response to accelerated customer demand for digital service capability to tackle the challenges of the pandemic and include support for remote workers, online citizen services, virtual inspections, managing the process of re-opening businesses, and more. In July, the COVID-19 Response Solutions received a 2020 Microsoft US Partner Award for ""Community Response,"" recognizing Accela\'s innovation in empowering state and local governments to respond to increasingly challenging external events by transitioning critical citizen services online. By leveraging Accela to provide digital services prior to the pandemic, Charlotte, North Carolina was able to continue business as usual amidst the new work-from-home paradigm. The fastest-growing metropolitan area in the nation, Charlotte, North Carolina, needed to improve customer experience and quickly overcome the physical challenges presented by COVID-19. With the help of Accela, Charlotte had moved its entire planning process online in 2008, which enabled a seamless transition into remote work for office staff when ""shelter-in-place"" orders went into effect. By offering digital citizen services, the city could continue providing quality service to citizens remotely during a time when traditional methods would have been impeded or stopped project owners in their tracks. ""The City, being an early adopter of Accela, and using the product, has made what could have been a horrible experience almost seamless,"" said Nan Peterson, Business Relationship Manager, for the City of Charlotte. ""We basically walked out the door that Tuesday night, and by Wednesday people were back to work at their home office wherever that might be, working seamlessly."" Other major company, partnership, and event milestones achieved last quarter include the following: Accela successfully completed over 200 customer migrations from Accela\'s data center-hosted solution to its SaaS infrastructure powered by Azure, completing the project in just nine months. Accela\'s open, flexible, and secure cloud solutions hosted on Azure offer agencies a wide variety of benefits by centrally hosting and maintaining all infrastructure and application software. These include increased agility to navigate the shifting civic landscape, radically decreased deployment time, financial predictability, and more. The shift improves Accela\'s ability to continuously ramp capacity to meet the influx of demand for its cloud offering. Further, it enables Accela to take advantage of Microsoft\'s growing suite of Azure applications, increasing Accela\'s pace of innovation. SaaS Mag named Accela one of the world\'s fastest-growing SaaS companies for the second consecutive year on its SaaS 1000 list. The San Francisco Business Times named Accela among the 2020 Top 50 Largest East Bay Tech Employers. Microsoft awarded Accela in its One Commercial Partner (OCP) FY21 Q1 Winners Circle program within the category of Top IP Co-Sell ACR in the Public Sector by an ISV partner. The program rewards top managed partner performance on key Microsoft U.S. metrics from the previous quarter, effectively helping Microsoft and its partners\' customers digitally transform. To help simplify fire inspections and fuel emergency preparedness, Accela hosted a three-part webinar series hosted with Microsoft Director of Justice and Public Safety Solutions Rick Zak on how to leverage SaaS technology to build safer communities, as fire departments face rising challenges from the pandemic and peak fire season simultaneously. Accela redesigned its annual conference and training event, Accelarate, to be 100 percent virtual in 2020. This year\'s speakers included Microsoft Executive Director of State and Local Government Solutions Kim Nelson, acclaimed documentary filmmaker Brett Culp, and Accela CEO Gary Kovacs. Accela works with over 80 percent of the largest cities in the United States. More than 80 percent of Accela\'s new customers purchased its cloud solutions, and 66 percent of all Accela customers are now in the cloud.

The flexibility and agility of cloud-based models would support the IT service needs of enterprises. The leading CSPs/hyperscalersMicrosoft, IBM, and AWSare expected to increase their CAPEX primarily for data center expansion to support the increasing workload for their internal and external stakeholders. The increasing volume of data generation in websites and mobile apps, rising focus on delivering customer-centric applications for driving customer satisfaction, and growing need to control and reduce Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) are a few factors driving the growth of the emerging technologies. The emerging technologies, such as big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) are gaining traction, which is ultimately leading to the growth of the DRaaS Market, globally. Browse in-depth TOC on""DRaaS Market""251 Tables43 Figures 230 Pages Download PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=962 The sudden shutdown of offices, schools, colleges, and physical retail stores has massively disrupted operations; this has led to an increase in the demand for digital workplace tools and services, such as Zoom, Slack, Blackboard, Lynda, Canvas, Google Classroom, AnyMeeting, and Moodle. AWS, Microsoft, and Google host and manage all applications in a public cloud environment. Increased spend on cloud services by select industries due to COVID-19. Industries, such as IT and ITeS, telecom, online retail/commerce, media, and BFSI, are expected to increase spending on cloud-based services to sustain their business. Highly regulated and cash-rich industries, such as BFSI, are also expected to move selective workloads to public cloud environments. The market is expected to be driven by the need of backup and restore services Backup is the process of copying data in cloud computing environments. It enables the retrieval of duplicate sets in case of data loss during downtime or failures, such as power outages, human errors, and natural catastrophes. Recovery refers to the restoration of deleted or damaged files from storage media in the event of disasters. The data recovery process refers to the state of the recovery of specific data that becomes inaccessible because of logical or physical damages to targeted storage devices. The need for backup is increasing among businesses due to the rising amount of data. Backup offers various benefits to enterprises, including increased agility, data retention, lower costs, faster deployments, and improved data protection. It provides cost-effective, automated, reliable, secure, and scalable solutions. Increased security capabilities and customized costing in private cloud-based services is driving the adoption of private cloud-based deployment As security is the most important concern, many organizations are in favor of adopting the private cloud deployment model within corporate firewalls. This would help companies have better control over data, reduce the risk of data loss, and avoid issues related to regulatory compliance. Due to these benefits, many enterprises prefer private cloud to ensure safety and security. Private cloud deployment models are created for specific groups or organizations that require customization and control over their data. Enterprises opt for the implementation of DR services over private cloud, as it provides a highly secure and centralized storage infrastructure that can only be accessed by authorized users. Private cloud is a secure, cloud-based environment with high security, enabling end-users to store and process critical data.

Tailscale is a new kind of corporate VPN that helps remote teams and organizations securely access the services they need. Leveraging zero-trust architecture from BeyondCorp at Google and the WireGuard protocol, Tailscale makes network security accessible to teams of any scale. The company launched in April with a Seed round and has since served tens of thousands of customers a month including DC Energy's trading markets and Oxide's bare metal business. The company has grown organically and plans to use the funds to continue to scale their engineering team and build out their first marketing and sales teams, following incredible word-of-mouth traction. Networking and security have become obstacles that slow teams down, Tailscale believes that complex network connections can be trustworthy and simple. A large fraction of the workforce is remote for the first time, forcing teams of every size to rethink security, said Avery Pennarun, co-founder and CEO of Tailscale. We offer an easy and fast way to leverage secure private networks without any additional resources or upfront costs, so that teams can focus on productivity, not their VPN. Tailscale is fast, works from anywhere, and stays connected, even when moving between networks. As a software-only solution Tailscale offers minimal latency and works with existing identity services, like GSuite, Microsoft 365, and Okta, so authentication is seamless. Tailscale is set up and configured in a matter of minutes on average, while other solutions take weeks to fully implement and require several hours a week to maintain for DevOps teams. Because Tailscale doesnt pass traffic through any intermediaries, it always has the optimal routing between any two points, unlike every other VPN. Tailscale is defining a new market, where secure network connectivity doesnt need to be a complex and expensive undertaking reserved for companies with tons of resources, said Amit Kumar, Partner at Accel. Its been amazing to see what Tailscale has accomplished just through word of mouth within the tech community. The organic excitement from engineers has been remarkable. After launching a few months ago, theyve been adding tens of thousands of new nodes each month, reinforcing a breakout leadership position within this emerging category. As physical VPN gateways have become overloaded during the shift to remote work, companies are attempting to scale VPN gateways through expensive equipment. Tailscale offers a software alternative by orchestrating a mesh network that connects nodes to one another with WireGuard, mimicking an internal physical network. Mesh networks help spur the digital IT transformation of organizations who have been hoping to adopt a Zero Trust approach to network security and connectivity, but havent had the resources to implement. Tailscale sits on top of existing infrastructure, can be deployed just where its needed, and easily integrates with existing two factor authentication. Tailscale helped us to quickly move from a traditional VPN setup to a flexible, BeyondCorp-style network, said Ware Adams, co-founder, Chief Risk Officer and Managing Director of DC Energy. Tailscales combination of incremental deployment and strong security controls made it easy to get started with a couple of users and, later, extend it to the entire staff. Existing tools and practices for secure network access must be rethought from first principles. Individuals and teams have been largely left to their own devices to sort this out, said Joseph Ruscio, General Partner at Heavybit. The reality is that distributed teams require distributed networks. Tailscale makes it trivial for them to set up safe, shared, private networks with the access they need and the ability to be productive from anywhere. About Tailscale Tailscale is a new kind of corporate VPN that requires no hardware or infrastructure and sets up in minutes. Founded in 2019 by ex-Google engineers, the company is backed by Accel, Heavybit, and Uncork Capital.

The technology, originally targeted for those with chronic conditions outside the clinical setting, can measure and be applied to a variety of industries ultimately improving understanding of health and performance for areas like athletics, military and more. As COVID-19 ushers in a new era of telehealth, technologies like Alio\'s SmartPatchhave come to the forefront of the conversation around remote patient monitoring. For far too long we have relied on inaccurate, siloed and incomplete data to understand health and performance. Furthering the problem, solutions allowing for more accurate reporting are often invasive and uncomfortable. By improving the user experience, and designing a ""forgettable"" wearable patch, Alio increases user compliance, enhances insights and allows for better care and performance outside of the clinical setting. Alio, formerly GraftWorx, recently rebranded to better represent their vision for the future of healthcare. Alio is a medical technology company that uses remote patient monitoring to help patients better manage their chronic conditions and individuals gain better insight into their health. The SmartPatch can measure metrics like skin temperature, oxygen saturation, pulse rate variability, blood pressure, potassium, hemoglobin/hematocrit and more. This industry disrupting technology has been developed under the guidance of seasoned industry veterans from organizations like GoogleX, Medtronic, mCube, Microsoft Research, PARC and National Semiconductor. ""Regardless of your specific use case, our solution is designed to create a better experience. Until now we have relied on inaccurate, incomplete or siloed data to generate an understanding of our lives outside of the clinical setting,"" said David Kuraguntla, Alio\'s Co-Founder and CEO. ""By providing a noninvasive, comfortable and clinically accurate wearable, compliance for wearable devices will be improved, providing clinicians, trainers, and organizations with better visibility into key clinical metrics and even reduce avoidable hospitalizations or health complications."" The organization has realized the potential of its technology and begun to apply it to industries outside of its original target market of chronic conditions. The Alio remote monitoring platform is vertically integrated with proprietary sensing technology and harmoniously connects with other clinical sensor products, providing an effortless solution for retrieving vital data. Alio\'s partnerships have allowed them to expand and hone their technology through a series of feasibility studies. ""There is so much more we can know about our dialysis patients\' health from technology like Alio\'s,"" said Ray Morales, Executive Operations Director, Intermountain Healthcare Kidney Services. ""It\'s time we embrace new technologies that make managing our vitals comfortably and reliably while maintaining consistency and accuracy. It\'s simply not enough to accept the unknown given how technologies like Alio have progressed."" Through robust and diverse partnerships, Alio has been able to further enhance and develop the technology behind the SmartPatch. As of August 2020, Alio has launched a clinical partnership with Intermountain Healthcare.

With the new iOS, Android and Microsoft apps, Keyavi customers can now easily and quickly protect their data files with the same multi-layered intelligence, self-protection and self-awareness as they do now using Keyavis application programming interface (API) or desktop client software products. The apps are available for download through Google Play, the Apple store and shortly on the Microsoft store. Once a Keyavi app is installed, a licensed user of Keyavis security products can transform any type of data file into intelligent data whether its an email, Word document, text file, spreadsheet, pdf, video, or any other file type and infuse powerful controls into that data: whos allowed to see it, when and where its accessed, by whom and on what devices forever, said Elliot Lewis, CEO of Keyavi Data. They can then send those multi-layered, encrypted files to anyone inside or outside their organization, knowing their data will stay under control even after leaving their possession, Lewis explained. Before sharing an intelligent Keyavi-infused file, customers can also grant or refuse access for specific individuals or groups of people by geographic location as well as set specific date and time limits, or any combination thereof, for accessing the file. Because the owner can also change or revoke permission parameters on the fly from his or her smart device or computer at any time, the data always stays under the owners control, regardless of where the data is located or who has it forever. Should an unauthorized user try to gain access or steal data without appropriate permissions, the data self-protects, much like a Mission Impossible message. Anyone whos authorized to open a Keyavi-secured file can now simply double-click on it even if the recipient doesnt have a Keyavi user license or has never seen a Keyavi-infused file before, Lewis explained. Android, Apple and Microsoft will automatically point mobile users to the right app for downloading, then open the intelligent Keyavi file using our free viewer. Keyavis online viewer, which operates seamlessly in the apps background, allows an authorized recipient of the intelligent file to access it in read-only mode in its native application on a mobile device. If, for example, a Microsoft Word file is protected at the outset with Keyavis patented technology, the recipient of that file can easily view it in Word if their mobile device has the appropriate Windows plug-in and mobile app installed. Now, we offer the same powerful functionality of our desktop client in our mobile apps, so that users can control their intelligent data anytime, anywhere, on any device, said Lewis. Because Keyavi never accesses, stores or otherwise intercepts anyone's data, our lightweight Keyavi apps and viewer enable the highest level of data protection, run seamlessly in the background and require minimal memory. Included in every user license are the desktop client, mobile apps and a robust Microsoft Office plug-in. You only need to download a mobile app or open a web client once to open all subsequent Keyavi-protected files, he added. Keyavis new web client looks and behaves like the company's desktop software product, with the same security protocols but with additional browser-specific functionality. No one else has anything close to this technology, Lewis said. Keyavi is the only company in the world to have set, and met, this high bar for universal data security. Its an enormous, evolutionary step for the entire cybersecurity industry. And were well on our way to achieving our companys mission: giving data owners back control of their data wherever it goes, whoever has it, forever. Keyavis technology has proven essential for customers in protecting their data against all forms of cyber attacks and intentional or accidental data loss as they manage through the COVID-19 pandemic and secure their remote employees home-based work environments. Customers of Keyavis revolutionary technology include major companies in hospitality, gaming, financial services, law firms, technology and manufacturing. Federal, state and local governments are also in various stages of evaluation and deployments. About Keyavi Data Corp. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Keyavi Datas transformative cybersecurity technology makes any type of data self-protecting by infusing multi-layered protections into the actual data itself. This innovative technology now available as an API, client software product, mobile apps and web client makes data intelligent and self-aware of where it is, who has it and what device it is on to determine whether it is authorized by its owner at that time to allow access. Under development for over a decade before launching in 2020, this game-changing cybersecurity technology has been awarded 15 U.S. patents thus far and is compliant with FIPS-140-2 for NIST. For companies and government entities that need to control confidential and intellectual property from accidental loss or a cyber attack, Keyavis easy-to-use yet robust security delivers the ultimate peace of mind.

This Data Science-powered report presents a forward-looking analysis of the latest financial results of the five Big Tech companies in the U.S. and explains the drivers behind sales and profits at global, segment, product and geography levels. Each important element is visualized and helps in forming a comprehensible understanding of ongoing company processes. The report also contains high-quality printable dashboards which enables grasping the ""whats"" and ""whys"" within a minute. It can be used to support important decisions, to win an executive argument, in a presentation or in strategic analysis.Additionally, the report includes next-quarter forecasts derived from current company drivers and economic environment and contains expectations for the upcoming six to twelve-month period. This knowledge helps not only to be perfectly informed but also continuously expands the circle of competence on companies, products, industries and geographies.Public companies continually release materials such as earnings reports, industry and investor presentations or management discussions. Taken as they are, earnings reports divulge very little valuable information which is often kept scarce by the companies themselves on purpose. The analysis brings meaning to earnings reports by providing the reasons behind reported numbers. The report answers questions such as: ""Why iPhone sales fell 20.74%?"" or ""Why YouTube Ads revenues increased 32.41%?""It\'s those answers that reveal the processes called drivers that are shaping a company\'s future. Being aware of them gives the ability to act preemptively on events that will become known to the public months later.Using this knowledge, the publisher starts assessing the direction and magnitude of each driver and predicts with a high level of confidence the company\'s future performance. Their technology helps to selectively reduce the large volume of data into those nodes of information that carry real value and can empower personal knowledge in an efficient manner.As an investor, business leader, adviser or money manager this will greatly reduce the margin of error when taking action against the upcoming risks that surround us.

Tailscale is a new kind of corporate VPN that helps remote teams and organizations securely access the services they need. Leveraging zero-trust architecture from BeyondCorp at Google and the WireGuard protocol, Tailscale makes network security accessible to teams of any scale. The company launched in April with a Seed round and has since served tens of thousands of customers a month including DC Energy's trading markets and Oxide's bare metal business. The company has grown organically and plans to use the funds to continue to scale their engineering team and build out their first marketing and sales teams, following incredible word-of-mouth traction. Networking and security have become obstacles that slow teams down, Tailscale believes that complex network connections can be trustworthy and simple. A large fraction of the workforce is remote for the first time, forcing teams of every size to rethink security, said Avery Pennarun, co-founder and CEO of Tailscale. We offer an easy and fast way to leverage secure private networks without any additional resources or upfront costs, so that teams can focus on productivity, not their VPN. Tailscale is fast, works from anywhere, and stays connected, even when moving between networks. As a software-only solution Tailscale offers minimal latency and works with existing identity services, like GSuite, Microsoft 365, and Okta, so authentication is seamless. Tailscale is set up and configured in a matter of minutes on average, while other solutions take weeks to fully implement and require several hours a week to maintain for DevOps teams. Because Tailscale doesnt pass traffic through any intermediaries, it always has the optimal routing between any two points, unlike every other VPN. Tailscale is defining a new market, where secure network connectivity doesnt need to be a complex and expensive undertaking reserved for companies with tons of resources, said Amit Kumar, Partner at Accel. Its been amazing to see what Tailscale has accomplished just through word of mouth within the tech community. The organic excitement from engineers has been remarkable. After launching a few months ago, theyve been adding tens of thousands of new nodes each month, reinforcing a breakout leadership position within this emerging category. As physical VPN gateways have become overloaded during the shift to remote work, companies are attempting to scale VPN gateways through expensive equipment. Tailscale offers a software alternative by orchestrating a mesh network that connects nodes to one another with WireGuard, mimicking an internal physical network. Mesh networks help spur the digital IT transformation of organizations who have been hoping to adopt a Zero Trust approach to network security and connectivity, but havent had the resources to implement. Tailscale sits on top of existing infrastructure, can be deployed just where its needed, and easily integrates with existing two factor authentication. Tailscale helped us to quickly move from a traditional VPN setup to a flexible, BeyondCorp-style network, said Ware Adams, co-founder, Chief Risk Officer and Managing Director of DC Energy. Tailscales combination of incremental deployment and strong security controls made it easy to get started with a couple of users and, later, extend it to the entire staff. Existing tools and practices for secure network access must be rethought from first principles. Individuals and teams have been largely left to their own devices to sort this out, said Joseph Ruscio, General Partner at Heavybit. The reality is that distributed teams require distributed networks. Tailscale makes it trivial for them to set up safe, shared, private networks with the access they need and the ability to be productive from anywhere. About Tailscale Tailscale is a new kind of corporate VPN that requires no hardware or infrastructure and sets up in minutes. Founded in 2019 by ex-Google engineers, the company is backed by Accel, Heavybit, and Uncork Capital.

The technology, originally targeted for those with chronic conditions outside the clinical setting, can measure and be applied to a variety of industries ultimately improving understanding of health and performance for areas like athletics, military and more. As COVID-19 ushers in a new era of telehealth, technologies like Alio\'s SmartPatchhave come to the forefront of the conversation around remote patient monitoring. For far too long we have relied on inaccurate, siloed and incomplete data to understand health and performance. Furthering the problem, solutions allowing for more accurate reporting are often invasive and uncomfortable. By improving the user experience, and designing a ""forgettable"" wearable patch, Alio increases user compliance, enhances insights and allows for better care and performance outside of the clinical setting. Alio, formerly GraftWorx, recently rebranded to better represent their vision for the future of healthcare. Alio is a medical technology company that uses remote patient monitoring to help patients better manage their chronic conditions and individuals gain better insight into their health. The SmartPatch can measure metrics like skin temperature, oxygen saturation, pulse rate variability, blood pressure, potassium, hemoglobin/hematocrit and more. This industry disrupting technology has been developed under the guidance of seasoned industry veterans from organizations like GoogleX, Medtronic, mCube, Microsoft Research, PARC and National Semiconductor. ""Regardless of your specific use case, our solution is designed to create a better experience. Until now we have relied on inaccurate, incomplete or siloed data to generate an understanding of our lives outside of the clinical setting,"" said David Kuraguntla, Alio\'s Co-Founder and CEO. ""By providing a noninvasive, comfortable and clinically accurate wearable, compliance for wearable devices will be improved, providing clinicians, trainers, and organizations with better visibility into key clinical metrics and even reduce avoidable hospitalizations or health complications."" The organization has realized the potential of its technology and begun to apply it to industries outside of its original target market of chronic conditions. The Alio remote monitoring platform is vertically integrated with proprietary sensing technology and harmoniously connects with other clinical sensor products, providing an effortless solution for retrieving vital data. Alio\'s partnerships have allowed them to expand and hone their technology through a series of feasibility studies. ""There is so much more we can know about our dialysis patients\' health from technology like Alio\'s,"" said Ray Morales, Executive Operations Director, Intermountain Healthcare Kidney Services. ""It\'s time we embrace new technologies that make managing our vitals comfortably and reliably while maintaining consistency and accuracy. It\'s simply not enough to accept the unknown given how technologies like Alio have progressed."" Through robust and diverse partnerships, Alio has been able to further enhance and develop the technology behind the SmartPatch. As of August 2020, Alio has launched a clinical partnership with Intermountain Healthcare. Based in Utah, Intermountain is a not-for-profit system of 24 hospitals, 170 clinics, a Medical Group with 1,500 physicians, and a health plans division. The partnership will capitalize on Alio\'s proprietary technology to further Intermountain\'s vision of helping people live the healthiest lives possible.

As enterprises increasingly adopt a work from anywhere model, IT teams face unprecedented challenges to efficiently manage PC upgrades and migrations. Each upgrade presents new obstacles, whether its spotty connections, low upload speeds, or specialized applications. With the industrys first cloud integration, the new release of PCmover Enterprise gives IT teams another user-friendly transfer option as well as powerful tools for managing large number of migrations simultaneously. There is no-one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to PC migrations at the enterprise scale, particularly when you add remote workers to the mix, said Thomas Koll, CEO at Laplink. Thats why were giving our many enterprise customers around the globe the added flexibility of leveraging the scale and convenience of the cloud for managing migrations, while also making it easier to manage high volumes of migrations. Cloud transfers add flexibility In addition to direct and file-based transfers, PCmover Enterprise now offers cloud transfers with Azure, AWS and Google clouds. Use of the cloud allows IT administrators to adapt to a range of user scenarios. For instance, in the case of a remote user with slow upload speeds, the user would simply launch a secure upload of their files, settings and data to the cloud via PCmover running on their local PC on a Friday evening. The following Monday, the IT admin loads the data onto the users new PC and ships it out via overnight mail. The next day, the user turns on their new PC and they are ready to go no support calls or panicked efforts to track down missing files, data or applications. PC refresh projects performed off-premises are extremely complex, and in some cases not even possible, said Timothy Worcester, director of customer experience at Laplink. The ability to perform asynchronous file-based transfers through the cloud will help IT teams overcome the roadblocks they often face with so many employees away from the office. PCmover Transfer Manager arrives Large enterprises also face the challenge of managing hundreds or thousands of ongoing PC migrations across corporate networks. With the new PCmover Transfer Manager, IT managers can completely manage and control multiple migration projects from a single PC. Once the PCmover service is loaded onto an organizations PCs, the deployment administrator can launch migrations remotely without needing to control via remote session or physically access the machine. This represents the industrys first data migration tool to support both on-premises and off-premises PC data migrations. PCmover Enterprise is used by the worlds leading organizations including two of the top four accounting firms, three of the top four automotive manufacturers, two of the top four universities and several government agencies as well as many other companies in consumer electronics, IT consulting, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and many other industries. In addition, Laplinks consumer product, PCmover, is available from Laplink.com, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Amazon, Best Buy, Frys, Micro Center, Office Depot, Staples, QVC, HSN and other major software retailers and PC manufacturers in North America, Europe and Japan. Go to Laplinks website to learn more about PCmover Enterprise. About Laplink Software, Inc. For nearly 40 years, Laplink has been a global leader in consumer, SMB and enterprise PC migration software, and has earned the loyalty and trust of millions of organizations and customers worldwide.

Only PCmovers proprietary technology includes full selectivity that transfers data, applications and settings from an old PC to a new one, even if the versions of Windows are different. The privately held company was founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington.', ""LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Keyavi Data Corp., a cybersecurity startup whose innovative technology is transforming the very nature of the data security industry, today launched four apps, a free online viewer and a web client that provide on-the-go-access to the same power and functionality of the companys product suite for preventing data leaks and making data breaches irrelevant. With the new iOS, Android and Microsoft apps, Keyavi customers can now easily and quickly protect their data files with the same multi-layered intelligence, self-protection and self-awareness as they do now using Keyavis application programming interface (API) or desktop client software products. The apps are available for download through Google Play, the Apple store and shortly on the Microsoft store. Once a Keyavi app is installed, a licensed user of Keyavis security products can transform any type of data file into intelligent data whether its an email, Word document, text file, spreadsheet, pdf, video, or any other file type and infuse powerful controls into that data: whos allowed to see it, when and where its accessed, by whom and on what devices forever, said Elliot Lewis, CEO of Keyavi Data. They can then send those multi-layered, encrypted files to anyone inside or outside their organization, knowing their data will stay under control even after leaving their possession, Lewis explained. Before sharing an intelligent Keyavi-infused file, customers can also grant or refuse access for specific individuals or groups of people by geographic location as well as set specific date and time limits, or any combination thereof, for accessing the file. Because the owner can also change or revoke permission parameters on the fly from his or her smart device or computer at any time, the data always stays under the owners control, regardless of where the data is located or who has it forever. Should an unauthorized user try to gain access or steal data without appropriate permissions, the data self-protects, much like a Mission Impossible message. Anyone whos authorized to open a Keyavi-secured file can now simply double-click on it even if the recipient doesnt have a Keyavi user license or has never seen a Keyavi-infused file before, Lewis explained. Android, Apple and Microsoft will automatically point mobile users to the right app for downloading, then open the intelligent Keyavi file using our free viewer. Keyavis online viewer, which operates seamlessly in the apps background, allows an authorized recipient of the intelligent file to access it in read-only mode in its native application on a mobile device. If, for example, a Microsoft Word file is protected at the outset with Keyavis patented technology, the recipient of that file can easily view it in Word if their mobile device has the appropriate Windows plug-in and mobile app installed. Now, we offer the same powerful functionality of our desktop client in our mobile apps, so that users can control their intelligent data anytime, anywhere, on any device, said Lewis. Because Keyavi never accesses, stores or otherwise intercepts anyone's data, our lightweight Keyavi apps and viewer enable the highest level of data protection, run seamlessly in the background and require minimal memory. Included in every user license are the desktop client, mobile apps and a robust Microsoft Office plug-in. You only need to download a mobile app or open a web client once to open all subsequent Keyavi-protected files, he added. Keyavis new web client looks and behaves like the company's desktop software product, with the same security protocols but with additional browser-specific functionality. No one else has anything close to this technology, Lewis said. Keyavi is the only company in the world to have set, and met, this high bar for universal data security. Its an enormous, evolutionary step for the entire cybersecurity industry. And were well on our way to achieving our companys mission: giving data owners back control of their data wherever it goes, whoever has it, forever. Keyavis technology has proven essential for customers in protecting their data against all forms of cyber attacks and intentional or accidental data loss as they manage through the COVID-19 pandemic and secure their remote employees home-based work environments. Customers of Keyavis revolutionary technology include major companies in hospitality, gaming, financial services, law firms, technology and manufacturing. Federal, state and local governments are also in various stages of evaluation and deployments. About Keyavi Data Corp. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Keyavi Datas transformative cybersecurity technology makes any type of data self-protecting by infusing multi-layered protections into the actual data itself. This innovative technology now available as an API, client software product, mobile apps and web client makes data intelligent and self-aware of where it is, who has it and what device it is on to determine whether it is authorized by its owner at that time to allow access. Under development for over a decade before launching in 2020, this game-changing cybersecurity technology has been awarded 15 U.S. patents thus far and is compliant with FIPS-140-2 for NIST. For companies and government entities that need to control confidential and intellectual property from accidental loss or a cyber attack, Keyavis easy-to-use yet robust security delivers the ultimate peace of mind. In todays growing locations of disparate workforces and partner ecosystems, Keyavi plays a critical role in making data leaks and breaches irrelevant.

The nonprofit church extension fund, with a strong history of growth and operational success, will use an integrated omnichannel banking solution including Finastra\'s Fusion Phoenix core and Fusion Digital Banking, and integrated solutions for document management, self-service account opening and account-to-account transfers in order to provide a robust experience to its customers. ""With Finastra, we will be able to provide our customers with a modern digital experience, in line with what they might receive at larger financial institutions,"" said Scott Achterling, President and CEO, Christian Investors Financial. ""We currently don\'t have a mobile app or online account opening capabilities services that our customers increasingly expect. Now, customers will be able to do this with a seamless, omnichannel digital experience that feeds directly into our core. New and existing investors will be able to open Demand Certificates and Term Certificates much more conveniently, enabling us to reallocate resources internally to better fulfill our mission."" In transitioning from its existing core processing system, which is run in-house, to Fusion Phoenix in the cloud, Christian Investors Financial will free up more time for staff to focus even greater attention on their customers, as they will no longer be responsible for running and maintaining their core and enterprise content management systems. The organization will leverage Microsoft Azure for system security, performance, and flexibility. ""A robust suite of digital services will meet the demands of Christian Investor Financial\'s customers, while an open and flexible core, run in the cloud, will future-proof the technology investment,"" said Chris Zingo, SVP and GM of Americas Field Operations, Finastra. ""As new technologies emerge, Fusion Phoenix can integrate with them with its progressive open API architecture, allowing Christian Investors Financial to take advantage of trends and opportunities more quickly and efficiently."" Leveraging multiple Finastra products to create a best-in-class, enterprise-wide solution will deliver additional operational efficiencies that promise to have a profound impact on CIF. For example, the Fusion Phoenix core integrates seamlessly with Finastra\'s Fusion LaserPro, CIF\'s current loan documentation and management solution, to automate loan onboarding for servicing on the core, eliminating the need to rekey loans manually. Because Fusion Phoenix is built entirely on Microsoft technology, CIF staff will find the system intuitive to use and enjoy seamless integration with Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Excel, and additional Microsoft reporting solutions. Fusion Digital Banking will provide Christian Investors Financial with a mobile app, giving its customers robust digital capabilities to manage their investments or loans anytime anywhere, from viewing e-statements to transferring funds. With the addition of Fusion uOpen, customers will also be able to open new Demand Certificates and Term Certificates. Through these capabilities, Christian Investors will be able to expand its reach and grow its customer base.

This year, videoconferencing company Zoom, whose usage has soared as more people work remotely, took top honors in the public-company rankings. Other companies focused on workplace collaborationa key theme during this work-from-home periodalso won places on the list. They include Slack, DocuSign, Box, Microsoft and Dropbox. On the private side, 10 of the top 25 companies, including No. 1 company Dataiku, announced financing rounds during the pandemic (through Nov. 1). These financings amount to more than $1.9 billion combined, according to Crunchbasedemonstrating another potential link between positive company culture and overall corporate performance and growth, said Neeraj Agrawal, a Battery general partner who specializes in cloud investing. In my 20 years as a venture-capital investor, Ive seen several tough markets, but never a period of such unique uncertainty. Today, the cloud companies that are succeeding are ones with great technology and product-market fit, but also those with savvy management teams who understand how to motivate employees during difficult circumstances, Agrawal said. This was true before the pandemic but is even more true now. CEOs need to be flexible and embrace new strategies--including distributed C-suites, all-remote onboarding processes, and mental health coverage as a company benefitas they build cohesive cultures for the long term. Florian Douetteau, the CEO of No. 1-ranked private company Dataiku, says his firm has deployed dedicated happiness managers to check on employees one-on-one. The company also ordered desks and computer monitors for all employees home offices and set up new communication channels to shore up morale, including an internal podcast and small fireside chats, in addition to larger employee meetings. We dont have all the answers by any means, but we know that we must continue to go the extra mile to keep our employees focused as we continue to grow our company, he said. We are humbled and honored that our employees ranked us so highly and allowed us to earn top honors on this list. Battery last released its highest-rated cloud companies list in the spring of 2019 and focused on employee ratings from the previous 12-month period. This time, we knew that any data collected before the pandemic would not be very consequential, since the virus has turned most companies upside down. So, we delayed the release of our list and focused on how employees rated companies from March through the end of August, when culture was particularly critical, Batterys Agrawal said. Thirteen of the top 50 private companies on the 2019 highest-rated list have since gone public or been acquired; they are: Zoom, Asana, Sonatype, Sprout Social, Segment, nCino, Looker, Slack, Health Catalyst, ThousandEyes, PagerDuty, Snowflake and Cumulus Networks*. Two of the companies on this years private-company pandemic list, Unity Technologies and Asana, staged public listings earlier this fall, after the close of the 2020 lists data-collection period. Agrawal added that all the innovative companies on this years lists are powering the trend of businesses increasingly turning to the cloud to run critical technology systems and softwarea trend that has actually accelerated during the pandemic. The highest-rated companies on both lists sell cloud technology in a range of areas, including sales-and-marketing, collaboration, development tools and finance. To qualify for the list, private cloud companies were required to have 200 or more employees; at least 20 employee reviews on Glassdoor during the six-month collection period; and have raised funding since July 2016. Public companies required at least $500 million in total enterprise value as of the end of Q3 2020, according to CapIQ. (A more detailed explanation of the list methodology is below.) The reports also include data from Glassdoor on how employees rate their companies senior leadership teams and gauge their views on how their companies businesses will perform in the next six months (though these additional data points did not impact the overall company ratings or rankings). Glassdoor is on a mission to help people everywhere find a job and company they love through greater workplace transparencya mission more important than ever in todays uncertain economy, said Christian Sutherland-Wong, Glassdoor CEO. The insights on Glassdoor that Battery has analyzed are provided by those who really know a company best the employees and their feedback during these times has proven immensely helpful to anyone looking for a job or a new employer. For reporting simplicity, the company ratings below are rounded to the nearest tenth of a point, though actual calculations extend beyond the thousandth decimal place to determine rank. The ratings are based on a five-point scale, with 1.0 denoting very dissatisfied, 3.0 indicating OK and 5.0 signaling very satisfied. Many third-party studies show that companies with high employee satisfaction often post stronger financial performance. Here are the highest-rated public and private cloud-computing companies to work for during the Covid crisis. The public list includes only the top 10 companies.

Here is a sample of what employees have to say: Glassdoor offers millions of the latest job listings online, paired with more than 70 million workplace reviews and insights for over one million companies around the world. Currently, the average company rating on Glassdoor is 3.5. When an employee submits a company review on Glassdoor, he or she is asked to give their opinion on some of the best reasons to work for their employer (pros), any downsides (cons), and is encouraged to provide advice to management. Employees are also asked to rate how satisfied they are with their employer overall, among several other workplace attributes employees can rate and review. Methodology: The private- and public-company reports identify cloud computing companies that are highest rated on Glassdoor, based on company ratings shared by employees, from 3/1/20-8/31/20. To be considered, a cloud company must have received at least 20 company reviews on Glassdoor during this timeframe. The private-company report tracks independent, non-public cloud companies that, according to Battery research and data from research service Crunchbase, are based in the U.S.; have a B2B business model; are categorized as SaaS, software, cloud computing and/or enterprise software, according to Crunchbase; have more than 200 employees as of 8/28/2020, according to company data provided to LinkedIn; and have raised funding on or after 7/01/2016. The public-company report tracks public cloud companies with a B2B business model that have at least $500 million in total enterprise value as of the end of Q3 2020, according to CapIQ. A companys senior-leadership rating and positive business outlook ratingindicating the percentage of employees who believe their employers business will get better in the next six monthswas not taken into account to determine rank or overall company rating on either list, though we display these added data points for additional insight into each of these companies. *By a company name denotes a current or past Battery investment.

CEOs need to be flexible and embrace new strategies--including distributed C-suites, all-remote onboarding processes, and mental health coverage as a company benefitas they build cohesive cultures for the long term. Florian Douetteau, the CEO of No. 1-ranked private company Dataiku, says his firm has deployed dedicated happiness managers to check on employees one-on-one. The company also ordered desks and computer monitors for all employees home offices and set up new communication channels to shore up morale, including an internal podcast and small fireside chats, in addition to larger employee meetings. We dont have all the answers by any means, but we know that we must continue to go the extra mile to keep our employees focused as we continue to grow our company, he said. We are humbled and honored that our employees ranked us so highly and allowed us to earn top honors on this list. Battery last released its highest-rated cloud companies list in the spring of 2019 and focused on employee ratings from the previous 12-month period. This time, we knew that any data collected before the pandemic would not be very consequential, since the virus has turned most companies upside down. So, we delayed the release of our list and focused on how employees rated companies from March through the end of August, when culture was particularly critical, Batterys Agrawal said. Thirteen of the top 50 private companies on the 2019 highest-rated list have since gone public or been acquired; they are: Zoom, Asana, Sonatype, Sprout Social, Segment, nCino, Looker, Slack, Health Catalyst, ThousandEyes, PagerDuty, Snowflake and Cumulus Networks*. Two of the companies on this years private-company pandemic list, Unity Technologies and Asana, staged public listings earlier this fall, after the close of the 2020 lists data-collection period. Agrawal added that all the innovative companies on this years lists are powering the trend of businesses increasingly turning to the cloud to run critical technology systems and softwarea trend that has actually accelerated during the pandemic. The highest-rated companies on both lists sell cloud technology in a range of areas, including sales-and-marketing, collaboration, development tools and finance. To qualify for the list, private cloud companies were required to have 200 or more employees; at least 20 employee reviews on Glassdoor during the six-month collection period; and have raised funding since July 2016. Public companies required at least $500 million in total enterprise value as of the end of Q3 2020, according to CapIQ. (A more detailed explanation of the list methodology is below.) The reports also include data from Glassdoor on how employees rate their companies senior leadership teams and gauge their views on how their companies businesses will perform in the next six months (though these additional data points did not impact the overall company ratings or rankings). Glassdoor is on a mission to help people everywhere find a job and company they love through greater workplace transparencya mission more important than ever in todays uncertain economy, said Christian Sutherland-Wong, Glassdoor CEO. The insights on Glassdoor that Battery has analyzed are provided by those who really know a company best the employees and their feedback during these times has proven immensely helpful to anyone looking for a job or a new employer. For reporting simplicity, the company ratings below are rounded to the nearest tenth of a point, though actual calculations extend beyond the thousandth decimal place to determine rank. The ratings are based on a five-point scale, with 1.0 denoting very dissatisfied, 3.0 indicating OK and 5.0 signaling very satisfied. Many third-party studies show that companies with high employee satisfaction often post stronger financial performance. Here are the highest-rated public and private cloud-computing companies to work for during the Covid crisis. The public list includes only the top 10 companies.

Here is a sample of what employees have to say: Glassdoor offers millions of the latest job listings online, paired with more than 70 million workplace reviews and insights for over one million companies around the world. Currently, the average company rating on Glassdoor is 3.5. When an employee submits a company review on Glassdoor, he or she is asked to give their opinion on some of the best reasons to work for their employer (pros), any downsides (cons), and is encouraged to provide advice to management. Employees are also asked to rate how satisfied they are with their employer overall, among several other workplace attributes employees can rate and review. Methodology: The private- and public-company reports identify cloud computing companies that are highest rated on Glassdoor, based on company ratings shared by employees, from 3/1/20-8/31/20. To be considered, a cloud company must have received at least 20 company reviews on Glassdoor during this timeframe. The private-company report tracks independent, non-public cloud companies that, according to Battery research and data from research service Crunchbase, are based in the U.S.; have a B2B business model; are categorized as SaaS, software, cloud computing and/or enterprise software, according to Crunchbase; have more than 200 employees as of 8/28/2020, according to company data provided to LinkedIn; and have raised funding on or after 7/01/2016. The public-company report tracks public cloud companies with a B2B business model that have at least $500 million in total enterprise value as of the end of Q3 2020, according to CapIQ. A companys senior-leadership rating and positive business outlook ratingindicating the percentage of employees who believe their employers business will get better in the next six monthswas not taken into account to determine rank or overall company rating on either list, though we display these added data points for additional insight into each of these companies. *By a company name denotes a current or past Battery investment.

They had realized that the mainframe was extremely expensive to maintain and also required specialist mainframe that were increasingly scarce. Since 1946, generations have relied on Southern Farm Bureau to provide superior service to its policy holders and agents, creating a legacy of ethical standards. With a mission to continue their core principles, SFBLI needed to improve their ability to meet today\'s customers\' expectations of speed and accessibility. The Asysco\'s analysis determined that SFBLI\'s Ingenium application largely consisted of IBM COBOL, JCL, and Easytrieve and used a DB2 database with a CICS TP monitor, all technologies that fell within Asysco\'s competencies to convert and migrate. Since the Ingenium application supports SFBLI\'s core business with thousands of end users, it is a critical application requiring high performance and availability. The migrated system has proven to be much more cost effective while still providing same or better operations levels. At the same time, the dependency on specialized mainframe skills was eliminated and the new infrastructure provides a sound basis for further innovation and integration. Such project required a partnership with a company that matched experience and integrity with an enthusiasm for success that characterizes SFBLI. This they also found in Asysco and formed the basis of a great partnership. ""I think companies should not get to what I call the \'tipping point\' and wait too long to move off the mainframe.""

Throughout the year, the company releases impactful data obtained from its AI engine, which has analyzed over 1 billion websites to provide an in-depth audit of how phishing and online fraud is affecting enterprises, SMBs, non-profits and the online consumer community. As predicted in the Bolster Q1 State of Phishing and Online Fraud Report, the number of phishing and scam sites continues to grow, with more than four million suspicious pages live today. The Internet is full of fraud and theft and cybercriminals are operating in the open with impunity, violating copyrights, misrepresenting brands and advocating deceit overtly. Surprisingly, Bolster found these criminals are not lurking in the shadows of the dark net, instead they are using mainstream ISPs, hosting companies and free Internet services the same that are used by legitimate businesses every day. The Bolster Q2 and Q3 State of Phishing and Online Fraud Report provides a summary of the most recent trends in phishing and scams, offers insights into the scale, breadth and scope of these attacks and takes a deeper look into the examples of recent attacks and how organizations can protect themselves. Key findings from the new report include: Phishing and online fraud scams accelerate: In Q2, Bolster saw an alarming, rapid increase of new phishing and fraudulent sites being created, detecting 1.7 million phishing and scam websites a 13.3% increase from Q1 2020. Phishing and scam websites continued to increase in Q2 and peaked in June 2020 with a total of 745,000 sites detected. On average, there were more than 18,000 sites created each day. Cybercriminals use common, free email services to execute phishing attacks: The most active phishing scammers are using free emails accounts from trusted providers including Google and Yahoo!. Gmail was the most popular with over 45% of email addresses. Russian Yandex was the second most popular email service with 7.3%, following by Yahoo! with 4.0%. Brand impersonation continues to escalate. Bolsters data reveals that the top 10 brands are responsible for nearly 44,000 new phishing and fraudulent websites from January to September 2020. Each month there are approximately 4,000 new phishing and fraudulent websites created from these 10 brands alone. September saw a near tripling in volume with more than 15,000 new phishing and fraudulent website being created for these top brands, with Microsoft, Apple and PayPal topping the list. COVID-19 is still a target, but less so. In the Bolster Q1 State of Phishing and Online Fraud Report, the company found that approximately 30% of confirmed phishing and counterfeit pagers were related to COVID-19, equaling over a quarter of a million malicious websites. Compared to Q1, these scams increased by 22%, following dynamic news headlines N95 masks, face coronavirus drugs and government stimulus checks. However, the good news is that these scams are declining month-over-month. Cybercriminals will continue to utilize natural news drivers. Though phishing and fraudulent campaigns outside of extraordinary events are on the rise, cybercriminals continue to demonstrate their agility from major events. In Q3, Bolster discovered scams connected to Amazon Prime Day and the presidential election. There was a 2.5X increase of fraudulent websites using the Amazon brand a logo in September, focusing on payment confirmation, returns and cancellations and survey for free merchandise. Where the presidential campaigns were fraught with counterfeiting and Internet trolling. With the holiday shopping season kicking off, the results of the presidential election and the New Year approaching, we anticipate the number of phishing and fraudulent activity to continue to rise, said Shashi Prakash, co-founder and CTO of Bolster. In anticipation of these events, criminals are sharpening their knives of deception, planning new and creative ways to take advantage of businesses and consumers. Companies must be vigilant, arming their teams with the technology needed to continuously discover and take down these fraudulent sites before an attack takes place. We are committed to working with our customers and partners to help combat this malicious activity, keeping companies and consumers safe. The full report can be downloaded here.

HELSINKI, Nov. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Tuxera, a world-leader in quality-assured storage management and networking software, announced that the company\'s SMB server implementation, Fusion File Share by Tuxera, now offers transparent compression to platforms outside of Microsoft Windows. Compressionis being rapidly and widely adopted in the storage industry as a feature in memory hardware, file system implementations, and also networking protocols such as Microsoft\'s server messaging block technology (SMB). The ability to compress files inline during transfer can significantly reduce bandwidth and transfer time. Microsoft released the transparent compression feature to their SMB protocol specification in early 2019. However, Tuxera is the first to implement SMB compression outside of Microsoft Windows, bringing this highly in-demand feature to Linux environments in enterprises around the world. Continue Reading Fusion File Share SMB by Tuxera featuring SMB compression Remote working, virtualization, and large datasets burden networks SMB is a ubiquitously used protocol for sharing files over a network. Migrating or copying large or many files over networks, including virtual private networks (VPNs), can place serious strains on network performance, cause bottlenecks, and take valuable time to wait for the transfers to complete. Remote working, data-driven applications with huge volumes of data, and the growing use of virtualization technologies are all placing enormous demands on networks around the globe. This is especially challenging for organizations or hosting-solution vendors that transfer data over long distances with many remote locations and in potentially high-latency conditions. The ability to do inline compression during data transfers using the SMB protocol will substantially alleviate these challenges. The feature is especially beneficial when moving large files or big data over networks such as virtual machine images, raw media files, devops, engineering, and life science data, or other applications with large files.Compression is a ""game-changer"" to SMB protocol developmentIn March 2020, Microsoft Principal Program Manager Ned Pyle called compression a ""game changer"" for SMB. Additionally, he presented the feature as ""long-awaited"" with substantially less network congestion, low CPU usage, and drastically reduced file transfer time.""We\'re really excited to be the first to deliver SMB compression to enterprise customers,"" says Heinrich von Keler, Director of Enterprise Solutions at Tuxera. ""Windows is a dominant force in the market, though the enterprise world is heavily reliant on Linux as well and is adopting Linux at an exceeding rate. By bringing SMB compression to Linux, we can open up entirely new use cases for enterprise customers especially for hosted storage and software-defined storage vendors. Operations that were typically done through other protocols can now be done in a cost-saving, time-saving manner using the widely-adopted SMB protocol instead.""Optimization and virtualization are two main use cases for compression""SMB compression is best put to use when network conditions are not optimal, or higher overall system efficiency is required, or hardware and power cost saving is a major factor. If the network is a bottleneck, then compression can speed up file transfers and reduce waiting time. After compression, there is less data during the transfer over the network,"" says Szabolcs Szakacsits, CTO of Tuxera.""This feature is also highly useful in Microsoft Hyper-V or virtual environments, where there are large disk images containing lots of repeated byte patterns. Those repeating bytes are easy to compress and can be moved rapidly over the network. So very large containers or disk images used by virtual machines can be migrated to another server with minimal downtime in between.""Tests reveal that Fusion File Share by Tuxera performs compression on par with Microsoft\'s implementation, with transfer speed-ups between 30 300% and network bandwidth savings between 20 70%, depending on the data pattern.More data, more Microsoft, and more virtualization bring SMB to center stageTuxera\'s implementation of the SMB compression feature comes in context of a recent report from the International Data Corporation (IDC) on the state of the Global Datasphere. IDC estimates the world will create, capture, copy, and consume 59 zettabytes (ZB) of data in 2020. This number will continue to grow rapidly, as the world will create more than three times the data over the next five years than in the previous five. Moreover, the IDC notes that the growth of the Global DataSphere is driven more by data consumed and analyzed, rather than data created. This particular insight ties in closely with the sharing of data and files over networks for multiple users and applications, which is the main use for the SMB protocol.Concurrently, Microsoft solutions where the SMB protocol has its roots are becoming more dominant in the enterprise market as a whole. A recent survey by leading IT-marketplace Spiceworksrevealed that 79% of respondents said their business primarily runs both Windows client and server operating systems. Moreover, Spiceworks indicates thatbusiness adoption of server virtualization will grow to 97% until 2022, with an impressive 60% of businesses using or considering using Microsoft Hyper-V as their preferred solution.Tuxera\'s SMB roadmap focused on performance, scalability, and advanced featuresTuxera\'s roadmap for its Fusion File Share SMB implementation is to keep pace with Microsoft\'s latest features, including advanced enterprise-grade ones such as compression. The company has a long-standing technical, business, and legal relationship with Microsoft and are part of their licensing program for the exFAT file systemand SMB technology.Fusion File Share\'s transparent SMB compression feature has been built based on Microsoft\'s documentation, ensuring seamless compatibility between Windows, Mac, and Linux environments. The ""transparent"" aspect of this feature is especially beneficial to end users, as no interaction is required on their part to compress or decompress files. Transparent compression is ready for immediate deployment with Fusion File Share to any interested parties.About TuxeraTuxera is the leading provider of quality-assured embedded storage management software and networking technologies.

The telco cloud growth will be driven primarily by cloud infrastructure-related investments, such as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), Management and Network Orchestration (MANO), and Cloud Native Functions (CNFs). By 2025, the telco cloud market will be worth US$10 billion in North America, US$9 billion in Asia-Pacific (APAC), and US$8.2 billion in Europe,forecasts global tech market advisory firm, ABI Research in its new whitepaper, The 36 Transformative Technology Stats You Need to Know for 2021. This introduction of cloudified environments in the telco business landscape also presents some shifts in the value chain. For example, telcos are now being presented a second option of telco cloud deploymentthe multi-vendor approach, in which different network equipment vendors are responsible for different components of the telco. ""While this approach seems to provide some benefits, such as avoiding single-vendor lock in, it also requires substantial coordination of effort, not only through robust MANO, but also between stakeholders during certain key phases of the telco cloud deployment, such as the design and planning phase,"" explains Kangrui Ling, 5G Core and Edge Networks Research Analyst at ABI Research. Another 5G Core and Edge Networks trend highlighted in the whitepaper: 5G network slicing stands to create approximately US$8.9 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 76%. ""Arguably that is a drop in the bucket for Communication Service Provider (CSP) service revenue. CSPs continue to possess strong network assets, namely low-latency, last-mile access and core network capabilities,"" Don Alusha, Senior Analyst at ABI Research points out. But for the broader industry, capturing significant new growth opportunity will vary in line with their corresponding digitization initiatives and readiness to adopt new technologies like 5G core networks and cloud-native principles. Conversely, hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon are cognizant of these dynamics and are positioning themselves accordingly with telco-specific solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Wavelength and Microsoft Azure Edge Zones, particularly on edge computing deployments. ""Though moderate in the next 5 years, new value creation abounds, but the jury is still out who captures what parts of the bigger emerging 5G edge and network slicing ecosystem,"" Alusha says. About the whitepaper, Stuart Carlaw, ABI Research\'s Chief Research Officer says, ""We have selected, from among the many millions of data points ABI Research creates each year, to focus on some enlightening data points that matter in the year ahead. Aspects like Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), private cellular networks, Open Radio Access Network (RAN), blockchain, smart manufacturing platforms, and even connected cows point to how technology advancements are allowing our physical world to be better connected, managed, and efficient.

The pandemic, now characterized as a second wave, has accelerated the process. Some companies Twitter, Facebook, Zillow, Raytheon, Square have already declared many employees will work remotely going forward. But more broadly, can employers match or exceed productivity in the long run under such a shift? Yes, says management professorKathryn Bartol at the University of Maryland\'s Robert H. Smith School of Business, whose recent research looks at how remote teams can communicate better. She says companies can be as productive when everyone is working from home, even without some of the elements that work so well in the office. Managers should be good at this, she says. ""If you can get the team to work well together and provide leadership give them some goals and purpose and also support you can definitely get people to work effectively when everyone is remote,"" Bartol says. ""You have to be empowering and get shared leadership on the team. That\'s critical to making this work."" Good managers and teams can remotely work out some of the things that work so well in person ""It just might take a little more effort to orchestrate,"" says Bartol. Here are some of the challenges they\'ll face, and tips to overcome them: Creative problem-solving:For teams that frequently huddled together in the same room to develop ideas and tackle problems, worry nottechnology can replicate that setting, Bartol says. A number of studies have shown that people can brainstorm and collaborate effectively with technology such as Zoom, Slack, Google Docs and Microsoft Teams. Managers can also work to keep people more engaged, she said: Have shorter meetings more frequently to keep things moving forward. And make sure people are well-prepared to give presentations or discuss set topics, so teams can use the group time to work together for brainstorming and problem-solving. And with few people presently traveling for work, it\'s easier to get full attendance in meetings as well as to inject fresh ideas by inviting people from outside the team to pop in digitally. Serendipity:With everyone scattered, those water-cooler conversations and lunchroom chats that lead to the kind of information-sharing that increases productivity obviously can\'t happen, at least in a literal sense. ""But it\'s not impossible to have some serendipitous conversations, especially if you try to have some open-ended kinds of things where people could get together and share ideas,"" says Bartol. Hold virtual office hours or breakout sessions within teams, she said. Allow time for people to have a bit of small talk before, after or during meetings. ""That\'s always been a good practice,"" she said, ""and it\'s especially true when everyone is remote."" Intentionally injecting some levity with virtual coffee and tea meetups, Zoom lunch gatherings or social activities like virtual trivia can also elicit serendipitous exchanges, she says. Camaraderie:Studies have shown the importance of close relationships with co-workers and having a ""work best friend."" Those relationships increase workplace satisfaction, and high workplace satisfaction increases productivity and decreases turnover rates. ""I do think it\'s harder to build deep friendships and camaraderie when everyone is remote,""says Bartol. ""But it\'s not impossible, especially if leaders are helping people to come on board"" by taking steps like arranging meetings specifically to introduce a new hire to the people they need to know to do their job well. Work/home balance:When you go to a physical workplace, you head home at the end of your workday. Now your office may be your dining room table, and work can easily extend beyond dinnertime. But, as Bartol points out, even before the pandemic, technology was already prompting longer hours. ""The workday can extend endlessly because everyone has access to the work materialsmuch more so than they used to,"" she says. Managers and teams should determine workday expectations to set ground rules for distinguishing work and home times. Come to agreements on work hours, how quickly you\'ll respond to emails and how many times, generally, you\'re going to meet each week or month, she says. ""The mistake that managers make with virtual teams is they try to be the traffic cop on everything and try to run things centrally,"" she says. ""A better way is to allocate responsibilities but within some kind of structure."" Keeping remote teams as productive as in-person teams comes down to good managers making sure people are working together, just like in an office settingbut likely with a bit more effort. ""If the team is dysfunctional, that\'s true in an office setting, too,"" she says. ""It\'s a matter of whether you can set up the tools and get people to share leadership and keep people involved and engaged.""

HELSINKI, Nov. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Tuxera, a world-leader in quality-assured storage management and networking software, announced that the company\'s SMB server implementation, Fusion File Share by Tuxera, now offers transparent compression to platforms outside of Microsoft Windows. Compressionis being rapidly and widely adopted in the storage industry as a feature in memory hardware, file system implementations, and also networking protocols such as Microsoft\'s server messaging block technology (SMB). The ability to compress files inline during transfer can significantly reduce bandwidth and transfer time. Microsoft released the transparent compression feature to their SMB protocol specification in early 2019. However, Tuxera is the first to implement SMB compression outside of Microsoft Windows, bringing this highly in-demand feature to Linux environments in enterprises around the world. Continue Reading Fusion File Share SMB by Tuxera featuring SMB compression Remote working, virtualization, and large datasets burden networks SMB is a ubiquitously used protocol for sharing files over a network. Migrating or copying large or many files over networks, including virtual private networks (VPNs), can place serious strains on network performance, cause bottlenecks, and take valuable time to wait for the transfers to complete. Remote working, data-driven applications with huge volumes of data, and the growing use of virtualization technologies are all placing enormous demands on networks around the globe. This is especially challenging for organizations or hosting-solution vendors that transfer data over long distances with many remote locations and in potentially high-latency conditions. The ability to do inline compression during data transfers using the SMB protocol will substantially alleviate these challenges. The feature is especially beneficial when moving large files or big data over networks such as virtual machine images, raw media files, devops, engineering, and life science data, or other applications with large files.Compression is a ""game-changer"" to SMB protocol developmentIn March 2020, Microsoft Principal Program Manager Ned Pyle called compression a ""game changer"" for SMB. Additionally, he presented the feature as ""long-awaited"" with substantially less network congestion, low CPU usage, and drastically reduced file transfer time.""We\'re really excited to be the first to deliver SMB compression to enterprise customers,"" says Heinrich von Keler, Director of Enterprise Solutions at Tuxera. ""Windows is a dominant force in the market, though the enterprise world is heavily reliant on Linux as well and is adopting Linux at an exceeding rate. By bringing SMB compression to Linux, we can open up entirely new use cases for enterprise customers especially for hosted storage and software-defined storage vendors. Operations that were typically done through other protocols can now be done in a cost-saving, time-saving manner using the widely-adopted SMB protocol instead.""Optimization and virtualization are two main use cases for compression""SMB compression is best put to use when network conditions are not optimal, or higher overall system efficiency is required, or hardware and power cost saving is a major factor. If the network is a bottleneck, then compression can speed up file transfers and reduce waiting time. After compression, there is less data during the transfer over the network,"" says Szabolcs Szakacsits, CTO of Tuxera.""This feature is also highly useful in Microsoft Hyper-V or virtual environments, where there are large disk images containing lots of repeated byte patterns. Those repeating bytes are easy to compress and can be moved rapidly over the network. So very large containers or disk images used by virtual machines can be migrated to another server with minimal downtime in between.""Tests reveal that Fusion File Share by Tuxera performs compression on par with Microsoft\'s implementation, with transfer speed-ups between 30 300% and network bandwidth savings between 20 70%, depending on the data pattern.More data, more Microsoft, and more virtualization bring SMB to center stageTuxera\'s implementation of the SMB compression feature comes in context of a recent report from the International Data Corporation (IDC) on the state of the Global Datasphere. IDC estimates the world will create, capture, copy, and consume 59 zettabytes (ZB) of data in 2020. This number will continue to grow rapidly, as the world will create more than three times the data over the next five years than in the previous five. Moreover, the IDC notes that the growth of the Global DataSphere is driven more by data consumed and analyzed, rather than data created. This particular insight ties in closely with the sharing of data and files over networks for multiple users and applications, which is the main use for the SMB protocol.Concurrently, Microsoft solutions where the SMB protocol has its roots are becoming more dominant in the enterprise market as a whole. A recent survey by leading IT-marketplace Spiceworksrevealed that 79% of respondents said their business primarily runs both Windows client and server operating systems. Moreover, Spiceworks indicates thatbusiness adoption of server virtualization will grow to 97% until 2022, with an impressive 60% of businesses using or considering using Microsoft Hyper-V as their preferred solution.Tuxera\'s SMB roadmap focused on performance, scalability, and advanced featuresTuxera\'s roadmap for its Fusion File Share SMB implementation is to keep pace with Microsoft\'s latest features, including advanced enterprise-grade ones such as compression. The company has a long-standing technical, business, and legal relationship with Microsoft and are part of their licensing program for the exFAT file systemand SMB technology.Fusion File Share\'s transparent SMB compression feature has been built based on Microsoft\'s documentation, ensuring seamless compatibility between Windows, Mac, and Linux environments. The ""transparent"" aspect of this feature is especially beneficial to end users, as no interaction is required on their part to compress or decompress files. Transparent compression is ready for immediate deployment with Fusion File Share to any interested parties.About TuxeraTuxera is the leading provider of quality-assured embedded storage management software and networking technologies.

Today, Apptio leverages a connection to Jira to ingest Atlassian customer data on Projects, Issues, Sprints, and Users into its Cost Transparency application. This connection allows joint customers to marry these ""work"" costs with the supporting resources, technology, and infrastructure costs to gain a full picture of their project and product development spending. With the expansion, the two companies will build on the level of integration and data exchange between their products, beginning with Apptio Cloudability and Atlassian\'s Jira Software and Jira Service Management. In the coming weeks, joint customers will be able to act on Cloudability optimization recommendations directly within Jira Software and Jira Service Management and view the resulting cost savings in Cloudability. Act On and Track Cloud Optimization Recommendations via Apptio Cloudability, Jira Service Management, and Jira Software Tweet this ""A first of its kind, this integration provides mutual customers with the ability to quickly and easily take action on opportunities for cloud cost savings,"" said Cameron Deatsch, chief revenue officer at Atlassian. ""We\'re always striving to provide teams, regardless of their area of focus, with the ability to work more efficiently. By leveraging Cloudability\'s optimization recommendations directly within Jira Software and Jira Service Management, developers and finance leaders now have the tools they need to work together."" ""The expanded relationship between Apptio and Atlassian will be immensely beneficial to our mutual customers. By connecting two of the most commonly used solutions in the enterprise, technology leaders will have the support they need to ensure that each dollar invested in the cloud is put to good use,"" said Scott Chancellor, chief product and technology officer at Apptio. ""We are looking forward to further collaboration, including leveraging Atlassian\'s fast-growing IT service management and configuration management database tools to help our customers accelerate decision making and return on technology investments."" As the first phase of a broader integration plan between the two organizations, customers will have end-to-end control over their cloud costs. Organizations running workloads on public cloud resources such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Compute, or Azure Managed Disk need to be able to continuously adjust their cloud resources to ensure they are appropriately sized to the performance needs of the workloads. On average, fully optimized cloud resources result in an initial 30 percent reduction in cost savings and 15 percent in cost savings on an ongoing basis.Here\'s how it works: When a user receives an optimization or rightsizing recommendation in Cloudability, they can directly push that recommendation to their service and engineering teams via Atlassian to execute (e.g., automatically create Jira Service Management change requests for an Amazon EC2 instance rightsizing recommendation). As the engineering teams execute on the recommendation, Atlassian pushes that update back to Cloudability to identify the decommissioned resources (e.g., the terminated EC2 instance) and the newly initiated resources (e.g., the newly-initiated, and smaller EC2 instance) and Cloudability will report on the status of the rightsizing work as well as the cost savings realized as a result. In future phases of expanded product integrations, Apptio and Atlassian will support the migration of applications and workloads from on-premise to cloud infrastructures, giving customers the ability to track migrations and analyze the total savings resulting from the migration.For more information about Apptio\'s partner ecosystem, visit https://www.apptio.com/company/partners/.

Cloud platform is divided into: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service). It is also classified into public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud types. Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05993227/?utm_source=PRN The public cloud platforms incorporate AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud and Baidu Cloud. There are a large number of private cloud platform providers such as open-source Openstack and varying Openstack-based platforms. Non-open source providers include VMware, Zstack, etc. Vehicle, infrastructure, cloud and network are crucial elements of cooperative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS) industry chain. This report highlights the ""cloud"" link, with emphasis on OEM-centric automotive cloud platform services. With supplier\'s cloud platforms as a foundation, OEMs build their own cloud platforms such as marketing & after-sale cloud platform, manufacturing & supply chain cloud platform, telematics cloud platform, autonomous driving cloud platform, simulation cloud platform and HD map cloud platform. Viewed from the tables above, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud are the first choice of OEMs and Tier1 suppliers. Huawei Cloud and Baidu Cloud are the rising stars. Of both top ten OEMs and top ten Tier1 suppliers that once adopted Amazon Web Services (AWS), more turn to Microsoft Azure as Amazon starts developing and testing autonomous vehicles. Quite a few OEMs stand on more than one cloud platforms. For instance, Volkswagen Automotive Cloud (vehicles, customers and services) uses Microsoft\'s technology, while Volkswagen Industrial Cloud (manufacturing and supply chain management) utilizes Amazon\'s. Telematics cloud platform is among the first automotive cloud platforms already in wide use. In 2017, Microsoft released the Microsoft Connected Vehicle Platform (MCVP), an Azure-based connected automotive platform which has won support from many Tier1 suppliers. The automotive cloud service platform Huawei introduced in 2020 defines more features otherwise: autonomous driving, HD map, battery safety, OTA, V2X and ""three powers"" (motor, battery and ECU). From above it can be clearly seen that IT giants post handsome cloud platform revenues at astounding growth rates, amid the booming demand from automotive sector for cloud services, which is fueled by the following: (1) Enhancement of automaker\'s production management, marketing activities and internal management, and digital revolution and synergy of related industry chains. (2) Digitalization of the process of automakers\' development, design, test, and validation of software and hardware, and remote R&D teams\' cloud synergy and cloud-based simulation (such as cloud service for firmware simulation). (3) Digitalization and CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Shared, and Electrified) of automotive products. This means software-defined vehicles, capabilities (e.g., connectivity, navigation, parking, entertainment and payment), and transition from a functional vehicle into an intelligent one cannot be achieved without the support of digitalized process and tools, and cloud services. (4) Building of the telematics platform for automakers, and the connection, service and operation platform among the four -- car users, automotive products, Internet digital ecosystems, and automakers and their industry chains, providing real-time online mobile interconnected third-space services such as navigation, entertainment and payment, for better user driving experience. (5) As ADAS/AD gains popularity and gets updated, AVs will generate 4TB data per day, which prompts a surging demand for cloud platform space. So BAT and Huawei lavish on automotive cloud platform involving operating system, simulation system, telematics system, autonomous driving software, and creation of software and application service ecosystem, considering it is the biggest source of their revenues after all. OEMs always want to take hold of vehicle data. Currently, leading cloud platform solutions have reserved data ownership of OEMs. For instance, AWS platform retains full ownership of data, while providing functions like machine learning, and special solutions for connectivity and AVs to help OEMs freely create unique brand experience. Quite a few OEMs set up their own cloud platform subsidiaries and big data centers. Take SAIC Cloud Computing Center as an example. The facility had a 6 or 7-person team, one data center and 5 or 6 cabinets at start and provided just basic cloud storage and IaaS environment. After evolution into Shanghai FinShine Technology Co., Ltd. in 2017, it now boasts a team with 150 talents, three data centers (Shanghai, Nanjing and Zhengzhou) and hundreds of cabinets, and adds software and platform services such as SaaS and PaaS. Up to now the company has owned more than 4,000 cloud hosts, over 10,000 virtual machines or containers, and 30PB storage space. Companies like SAIC investing heavily in cloud platform still need help from IT tycoons. For example, in 2018, Alibaba Cloud and SAIC together released a hybrid cloud computing service platform for automotive R&D simulation: SSCC (SAIC Simulation Computing Cloud). To reduce unit costs, IT giants not only build large-scale cloud platforms, but also enable AI algorithms and sundry tool chains and independently develop AI chips. Baidu Cloud, for example, has been a leader in autonomous driving cloud platform field by resorting to competitive DuerOS, Carlife, simulation platform, HD map, autonomous driving algorithms and Kunlun AI chip. OEM\'s cloud platform business cannot live without the help of IT firms.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05993227/?utm_source=PRN About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

WafCharm automatically customizes WAF rules based on their applications and system, and continuously adjusts and manages them. Users can now focus on business operations with fewer security worries as WafCharm takes care of: building, testing and tuning rules; researching vulnerabilities, and creating new rules. Deploying and operating WAF without a purpose-built tool like WafCharm is a time- and resource-intensive operation. And companies with limited resources are not able to respond immediately when problems happen, said Yosuke Matsuura, Infrastructure Team Leader of CAST PLATFORM at Hachidori, Inc., developer of chatbot and shift and attendance tools. With CSCs WafCharm, we\'ve been able to maximize WAF\'s security features in a hassle-free way. I highly recommend it to anyone deploying WAF. We compared a number of WAF solutions both on-premises and cloud-based before deciding on CSCs WafCharm. Solutions from other vendors had too many issues for a small team like ours to have to overcome, such as implementing a new cloud service and procuring new hardware, said Kunihiro Okamoto, General Manager of the Development Division at Coconala, Inc., developer of sharing economy services such as an online flea market for knowledge, skills and experience; a legal consultation website; and a market for handmade items. WafCharm is not only easy to use, it is also possible to start with the price range that matches the scale of the service. Now we are saving time and money. Equipped with CSCs patented WRAO AI engine, WafCharm uses machine learning to go through its database of over a trillion threat signatures to select the most optimal WAF rules for each application.

The study analyzes business adoption and usage trends before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing data from similar surveys of more than 750 IT professionals fielded one year apart. COVID-19 accelerated tech adoption and increased usage The findings show that months into the pandemic, 81% of businesses were using business chat apps such as Slack and Microsoft Teams in 2020, a significant increase from 67% in 2019. Additionally, with more people working from home than ever before due to COVID-19, communications preferences shifted: 37% of IT decision-makers reported workers preferred to use business chat apps over email up significantly from 31% in 2019. ""As the pandemic and work-from-home policies drove co-workers apart, digital communication tools were vital for bringing people together despite physical distance, said Peter Tsai, Senior Technology Analyst at SWZD. Over the past few years, business chat apps and web conferencing use were already on a steady growth path. The recent shift to a remote work normal has further accelerated the upward trajectory of these modern tools, often at the expense of legacy technologies."" With fewer in-person meetings taking place, adoption of web conferencing apps was up significantly year-over-year, growing from 69% of businesses in 2019 to 79% in 2020. Business adopters also reported that the frequency of using web conferencing tools went up by more than 10 percentage points for both internal and external communications. These tools are clearly useful, with 75% of IT decision-makers believing communications effectively meet business demands in 2020. However, there is certainly room for improvement. Nearly a third of IT support professionals reported users regularly experience technical difficulties with web conferencing. Remote security concerns drive communications in the future According to the recent 2021 State of IT report, more than half of companies are planning to have flexible work policies in place even after the COVID-19 crisis is over. As this work from anywhere model proliferates, geographically dispersed teams will become more common. As company-owned devices and data move outside of firewalls, security will be a top concern. The workplace communications study found an additional 11% of businesses plan to adopt secure communications solutions platforms by 2022, making this the biggest growth area among communications technologies. Additionally, while businesses use an average of five communications solutions today, some businesses will look to reduce complexity by consolidating tools. The research indicated an additional 10% of organizations plan to adopt unified communications solutions within two years. This suggests a shift from silos to platforms, which might help organizations keep data and communications workflows within a single unified stack. Methodology The surveys were conducted by Spiceworks Ziff Davis in July 2019 and July 2020 and included 750+ business technology buyers each wave from organizations across North America and Europe. Respondents represent a variety of company sizes, including small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises, in addition to a variety of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, non-profit, education, government, and finance.

The Web Summit is recognized as one of the pre-eminent meet ups in the industry; as Forbes has said, it is ""the best technology conference on the planet"" and is once again making global impact on the future tech and business ecosystem. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, people\'s work conditions and lives have changed for the worse. The purpose of this year\'s Web Summit was to rebuild confidence in society and explore future trends in the tech industry. Global companies ranging from major tech brands to rapidly growing start-ups listed on the Fortune 500 are all part of the community. Victor Ai, the founder and CEO of Terminus Group - the world-leading smart services provider - was a featured speaker on the first day of this ""Tech Davos"", and gave an insightful speech on the topic of ""Building the Future AI CITY,"" along with more than 800 speakers during nearly 100 hours of continuous discussions, interviews and keynotes. Other speakers who participated in the conference include Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Co-founder of LinkedIn, Dan Doctoroff, CEO at Sidewalk Labs, Liang Hua, Chairman of Huawei, Xiang Wang, Presidentof Xiaomi, and Ursula von der Leyen, Presidentof European Commission. Redefining the tech industry in times of uncertainty Believing in the idea of ""people working together,"" the technology conference drew even more online visitors this year. As the only AI entrepreneur from Asia invited to the summit, Victor Ai delivered an inspiring speech on how the AI CITY will enhance people\'s life in the future, and how this momentum can translate into empowering cities around the globe. He shared his personal stories and his own reflections as to why he believes it\'s now the time for the digital economy to become a vital part of the social fabric. He also highlighted the unique perspective on future urban life, where sustainability, data, aesthetics, and technology are integrated within the AI CITY and he highlighted how Terminus is developing the world\'s first pilot AI City project. Multiple tech giants and start-ups also shared their product lines and research results in a variety of field of related topics, including digital infrastructure, AI solutions fighting COVID-19, future cities, and the development of IoT(Internet of Things). As the pandemic has proven how global interconnectedness is important for the world\'s well-being, the tech leaders again pointed out that we need to work together to build up and deploy digital solutions to deepen our cooperation in the new economy. Explore the next-generation AI CITY Victor Ai, during the fireside chat with Terminus AI CITY designer Bjarke Ingels (Danish architect, founder and creative partner of Bjarke Ingels Group), mostly focused during his speech on how the AI CITY project leverages the potential of people, nature and society as a whole, and how it can improve our future life. He also mentioned that Terminus\' AI CITY project is 90% digitized. For instance, residents will be served by robots functioning on the basis of hardware and software designed by the company. ""It\'s going to be a very exciting experience for the residents of those cities, the city\'s governing institutions, and last but not least - for the businesses, as they will have to adjust and adapt to the digital transformation,"" Victor said. Victor also highlighted the new user experience the AI CITY will bring. Whilst the idea of a ""smart city"" has been mentioned many times due to its relevance to 5G and AI technologies, the idea of the AI CITY begs further explanation. ""By integrating the smart hardware and Terminus\' digital ecosystem, the AI CITY will take advantage of all the IoT (Internet of Things) sensors to connect the whole city. Our future city-level operating system will work just like Apple\'s iOS, it will connect everybody, every app, and the entire data analysis system together,"" Victor explained. ""We are the first company to build the prototype AI CITY and provide the on-the-ground systems to coordinate all the different vertical applications, such as smart parking, smart energy management systems, autonomous driving, smart retail, and more. The platform - TACOS (Terminus AI CITY Operating System) - is just like a smart car or a smartphone a lot of different technologies coming together, which will make the AI City alive and thrive."" While smart technologies were among the key topics at the summit, many companies shared their views on how AI-related technologies help to make the world a better place, especially amid this year\'s global health crisis. Siemens AI Lab scientists talked about the role of AI in creating a sustainable world in the future, focusing on keeping the balance between technologies and the potential risks they involve. Huawei attended the conference and focused on the fifth generation of wireless telecommunication technology, giving a speech entitled ""5G and beyond: The next steps in digital infrastructure."" Huawei senior vice president Catherine Chen Lifang spoke about the importance of building a diverse and inclusive digital economy in the future to come. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in her speech that the potential lying in the next wave of the digital transformation is enormous, stressing that the digitization and connectivity can change our reliance on geographical locations. She pointed out that digital technologies can give us the opportunity to make the location less relevant in determining the success of people and entire geographical regions. Technology is a major driving force and a decisive factor in where the world is heading in the foreseeable future. This year\'s pandemic accelerated the global innovation and digitization, which as a result can help keep businesses sustainable. As Victor said in his chat, the digital transformation emerges as a result of rapid technological progress, and it is the starting point for building a better future in the post-pandemic world. SOURCE Terminus Group', 'LONDON, Dec. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --Decentralized cloud data storage platform SINOVATEis developing its own in-house blockchain technology known as Deterministic Infinity Nodes (DIN). The potentially groundbreaking new tech works in unison with Incorruptible Data Storage (IDS) to create a new consensus system with security levels never seen before.Market Growth and Unsustainable Solutions Continue Reading SINOVATE The data storage industry is projected to exceed $80 Billion USD in the next 4 years as a result of the rise of mobile devices, the app market, and growth across Blockchain IoT, AI, and e-commerce. The market is split between mainstream providers (Amazon, Microsoft) and the new, more technically secure blockchain-backed (Storj, Filecoin) dCloud alternatives. Mainstream cloud data providers are struggling with consistent data breaches, exposing a whole range of sensitive information (logins, passwords, IP addresses), while some blockchain alternatives face problems with token inflation.What is SINOVATE?SINOVATE is a(SIN) decentralized cloud data storage platformthat offers a potential solution tothese ongoing problems. Its unique decentralized data storage network is backed by Deterministic Infinity Nodes (DIN) which interact seamlessly with Incorruptible Data Storage (IDS), through a novel protocol called bFTP (blockchain-based File Transfer Protocol).Masternodes Vs Infinity NodesMasternode networks support many other dCloud projects but most still suffer from issues with inflation. Although the (initial) high rate of return for masternodes projects is attractive to investors, this leads to inflation, reducing the incentive for a user to continue to maintain a node as the token falls over time, negatively affecting the network.SINOVATE\'S Deterministic Infinity Nodesreduce inflation and promote network growth through its Infinity Nodes. Infinity Nodes use a unique Proof of Burn (PoB) feature, burning a specific amount of SIN across the 12 month node lifespan. This counters inflation by reducing the amount of SIN in circulation, and creates a new proof of transaction type called BurnTx. Legacy masternode-based networks are susceptible to vulnerabilities and attacks which can result in reward stealing and node instability. Infinity nodes solve the new deterministic algorithm: lock/reward and PoB to bring provably fair deterministic rewards, with bulletproof stability, and network stability.DIN 1.0 Hard ForkOn the 21st of November 2020, SINOVATEconcluded a hard fork bringing online its innovative Deterministic Infinity Nodes (DIN) 1.0, at block 550,000. The network will consist of more than 1,800 DIN that will bring more data storage capacity to the network. There are already over 1,400 nodes running on the network with expectations of 5,000 nodes in 2021. DIN uses a deterministic score system based on Schnorr Signature to retrieve that data from IDS. bFTP allows the user to easily re-authenticate to any of the nodes that hold a copy of the stored data using the deterministic ""score"" algorithm.Incorruptible Data StorageIDS is being developed carefully to allow a fully secure and reliable network for a worldwide decentralized Cloud (Cloud 3.0). This demands the development of a variety of technical features. The first step of IDS will be delivered in Q2 2021 which will give the possibility to use the functionality ""DataStore"" for saving your file in the DIN of the blockchain, send mails with an unprecedented blockchain-based mailing system or write to your friends in a fully secure and anonymous way with SIN Mobile messenger.SINOVATE will go beyond to provide security, decentralization, and efficiency by updating the blockchain to the Bitcoin core 0.21 and by delivering a fourth generation of Proof-of-Stake (PoS4) built in-house that will allow adding passive incomes alongside DIN and the HCO program.To Infinity and BeyondExponential growth in numerous data-centric markets and the rise of mobile devices has exposed a severe lack of a viable long-term solution for the world\'s future data storage needs. Blockchain-based dCloud platforms do address some of the security failings of their mainstream counterparts, but many face questions of token inflation.SINOVATE\'s decentralized infinity node architecture and incorruptible data storage underlayer provide an incredibly secure foundation upon which new companies can be built, and its Proof of Burn feature offers both an answer to network sustainability and inflationwhile offering everyone involved a chance to benefit for being a part of its future vision for decentralized data. SINOVATE Blockchain DevelopersSINOVATE\'s rise in the dCloud Industry is largely thanks to its innovative blockchain developersXuantan Nguyen (Xtdev) and Giacomo Milligan. (Giaki3003/SINTOSHIS)Xtdev is a highly experienced Big data and data mining specialist. He is also the innovator of Deterministic Infinity Nodes and one of the lead developers and Master SINOVATORS of SIN.Giaki3003 is the second lead developer on SINOVATE team and fellow Master SINOVATOR.

The study analyzes business adoption and usage trends before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing data from similar surveys of more than 750 IT professionals fielded one year apart. COVID-19 accelerated tech adoption and increased usage The findings show that months into the pandemic, 81% of businesses were using business chat apps such as Slack and Microsoft Teams in 2020, a significant increase from 67% in 2019. Additionally, with more people working from home than ever before due to COVID-19, communications preferences shifted: 37% of IT decision-makers reported workers preferred to use business chat apps over email up significantly from 31% in 2019. ""As the pandemic and work-from-home policies drove co-workers apart, digital communication tools were vital for bringing people together despite physical distance, said Peter Tsai, Senior Technology Analyst at SWZD. Over the past few years, business chat apps and web conferencing use were already on a steady growth path. The recent shift to a remote work normal has further accelerated the upward trajectory of these modern tools, often at the expense of legacy technologies."" With fewer in-person meetings taking place, adoption of web conferencing apps was up significantly year-over-year, growing from 69% of businesses in 2019 to 79% in 2020. Business adopters also reported that the frequency of using web conferencing tools went up by more than 10 percentage points for both internal and external communications. These tools are clearly useful, with 75% of IT decision-makers believing communications effectively meet business demands in 2020. However, there is certainly room for improvement. Nearly a third of IT support professionals reported users regularly experience technical difficulties with web conferencing. Remote security concerns drive communications in the future According to the recent 2021 State of IT report, more than half of companies are planning to have flexible work policies in place even after the COVID-19 crisis is over. As this work from anywhere model proliferates, geographically dispersed teams will become more common. As company-owned devices and data move outside of firewalls, security will be a top concern. The workplace communications study found an additional 11% of businesses plan to adopt secure communications solutions platforms by 2022, making this the biggest growth area among communications technologies. Additionally, while businesses use an average of five communications solutions today, some businesses will look to reduce complexity by consolidating tools. The research indicated an additional 10% of organizations plan to adopt unified communications solutions within two years. This suggests a shift from silos to platforms, which might help organizations keep data and communications workflows within a single unified stack. Methodology The surveys were conducted by Spiceworks Ziff Davis in July 2019 and July 2020 and included 750+ business technology buyers each wave from organizations across North America and Europe. Respondents represent a variety of company sizes, including small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises, in addition to a variety of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, non-profit, education, government, and finance.

The survey unveils key perspectives of enterprise employees on workplace collaboration and communication in the midst of the global pandemic. Findings highlight gaps in stress levels between workers at different job levels and industries and how increased usage of collaboration and UC applications has impacted the success of internal communication at enterprises. Zoom Reigns King of CollaborationSince COVID-19 forced a large majority of the enterprise workforce into remote work, 72% of companies rolled out at least one new collaboration application. Zoom reigns king with over 50% of enterprises adding the application to their collaboration repertoire, but Microsoft Teams follows closely behind at 43%. Lack of Transparency in Security and GovernanceThe survey found a substantial disconnect between company leadership and lower-level employees related to the security of data and chats. Over 65% of owners, C-Levels, and executives admitted their organization had experienced security incidents related to collaboration or communications, while 83% of entry-level employees were operating with blinders not believing that their company was at risk of a collaboration mishap. Contrary to popular belief, only half of enterprises have implemented heightened governance and security prevention for collaboration applications since moving their workforce to a remote model. ""Even prior to the sudden departure from traditional workspaces, enterprises across the globe were being faced with countless disruptions and concerns regarding governance and security, for collaboration platforms,"" said Scott Gode, Chief Marketing Officer, Unify Square. ""The need for specialized third-party software, coupled with innovative professional services is more crucial than ever before to help highlight blind spots, and implement and enforce policies to minimize data loss risk."" Tech Workers Are Taking the Brunt of the StressIt\'s no surprise that stress levels amongst employees have increased in the wake of the pandemic. Sixty-one percent of technology workers and 63% of c-level employees stated their stress levels have risen since working remotely. Conversely, entry-level employees are able to stay relatively stress-free with only 34% admitting to feeling increased stress. Potential causes of stress include the personal challenges that employees are experiencing while working from home, such as missing the routine of being in the office (43%), collaborating with colleagues in person (41%), distractions at home (35%), and juggling personal duties on top of work (32%). Employers Aren\'t Keen on Fronting the BillGetting a home office up to the standards that employees are used to is a challenge for employers and employees alike. Over half of enterprise workers focusing on IT or Security have had to purchase new equipment or hardware (e.g. monitor, headset, webcam) to facilitate their work from home setup, however, only 12% said their employer helped or paid for it all financially. Even with the correct equipment and hardware, 42% of enterprise employees ages 18-24 years said that it took about a month to get their home-based office setup at the quality that it did when they were in the office. Yet, 40% of those 55 and older said it worked great from day one, which is a surprising comparison from their tech-savvy younger peers who would be expected to have less difficulty with their setup right off the bat. Home Offices Aren\'t All They\'re Cracked Up to BeInterference from pets (48%), someone walking through the background (33%), gardeners/contractors making noise (27%), children making surprise guest appearances (26%), deliveries making noise (26%), power outages (24%), noisy neighbors (21%), and cleaning service vacuuming or cleaning around your workspace (9%) were all noted as culprits for distractions while on a conference call. When the home office wasn\'t quite doing it for them, 22% of those ages 65 and older admitted to taking conference calls from unconventional locations including the closet, in a car, on a boat, in a store, from a child\'s sporting event, and even from the bathroom. Gaps in Productivity PerspectivesPerspectives on remote productivity become a major point of contention among enterprises and their employees. Nearly half of tech workers believe that there is a higher set of standards for productivity within their company since working remotely. The survey unveiled some gaps in perspectives around efficiency across job levels. Forty-four percent of owners, executives, and C-levels believe collaboration with teammates has become much more efficient since moving to a remote model, while only 11% of senior management agree. Yet 44% of employees said their organization has not taken any steps to help facilitate teamwork in a remote environment. Take a deeper look into the results, by tuning in to Unify Square\'s recent panel discussion, Uncovering New Unified Communication and Collaboration Platform Insights for 2021.

Promoting the progress of Hibob\'s mission to simplify people management, culture building, and employee engagement for remote and dispersed workforces, the investment will allow Hibob to drive wider global expansion while contributing to further Hibob product development. (PRNewsfoto/Hibob) Hibob has raised a total of $124 million to date since its launch in late 2015. The latest funding round follows its Series A+ financing in 2019, backed by investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures, Eight Roads Ventures, Arbor Ventures, Presidio Ventures, EntreCapital, Cerca Partners, and Perpetual Investors - all of whom have additionally contributed to the current capital raised. With triple-digit year-over-year growth in 2020, Hibob is quickly becoming a market leader, gaining strong traction with modern, mid-sized, multinational businesses. Since the company launched, Hibob has signed more than a thousand clients across the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, including fast-growing companies such as Monzo, Revolut, Cazoo, Happy Socks, Ironsource, Receipt Bank, Fiverr, Gong, and VaynerMedia. bob also closely integrates with third parties such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Mercer. The HR technology market has been around for decades, however, managers, employees, and HR teams alike increasingly understand its importance when it comes to operating a successful organization in today\'s employee-centric business environment. ""As we were developing the concept behind our HR platform, we looked at the world of work and recognized that it was changing. I\'ve spent my career managing people in different kinds of organizations and came to the realization that the vast majority of HR tech tools I used were not designed for the way people work today - globally, remotely, and collaboratively,"" said Ronni Zehavi, CEO and Co-founder of Hibob. ""We founded Hibob to create a modern HR platform built for the changing demands of the modern workplace.""""2020 was the year that pushed the practice of HR into the spotlight. HR leaders have been challenged to support their businesses and their people in new and different ways to drive communication, engagement, and development despite the obvious hurdles,"" said Claude Silver, Chief Heart Officer with VaynerMedia. ""At VaynerMedia, I knew that my ability to help our 1,000 employees grow through this tough year would only be possible with the right tools and structure in place. bob has enabled us to keep our people informed, engaged, and productive but perhaps most importantly, to nurture the unique culture and vibe that makes VaynerMedia such an exceptional place to work.""The market has embraced Hibob, as HR leaders in fast-growing companies recognize that their legacy tools are not suitable to help them thrive in the new normal of remote and hybrid work. Today\'s needs have gone beyond streamlining payroll and time tracking. Having a multi-generational workforce and global operations have made customization and social engagement capabilities, as well as amazing UI and UX experience, must-have requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic when HR leaders were forced to reinvent their operations model within weeks, the need has rapidly shifted to a system of engagement, empowering managers across companies to focus on people experience, culture transformation, social engagement, collaboration and transparency, and to thrive in the transition to remote work. ""Our investment philosophy includes investing in emerging HR SaaS leaders with platforms that deliver superior solutions, provide better value, and allow for an improved employee experience for scaling businesses,"" said SEEK CEO and Co-founder, Andrew Bassat. ""Hibob has been on our radar because of its strong value proposition and impressive business growth. Hibob has a great team led by an impressive and experienced founder, and has delivered an outstanding product to the market.

The objective of the report is to define, describe, and forecast the retail analytics market size based on component, business function, application, organization size, end-user, and region. The COVID-19 has impacted all elements of the technology sector. It has slowed down the growth of IT infrastructure owing to disruptions in the hardware supply chain and reduced manufacturing activities. This health crisis has had an unprecedented impact on businesses across industries; while some are struggling, others are thriving. Rising support from governments and several data analytics companies can help in the fight against this highly contagious disease. Businesses providing retail analytics solutions and services are also expected to witness a decline in their growth for a short span of time. However, the adoption of collaborative applications, IoT, analytics, security solutions, and AI is set to increase in the remaining part of 2020. The service segment to grow at a higher CAGR during the forecast period The services segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

The survey unveils key perspectives of enterprise employees on workplace collaboration and communication in the midst of the global pandemic. Findings highlight gaps in stress levels between workers at different job levels and industries and how increased usage of collaboration and UC applications has impacted the success of internal communication at enterprises. Zoom Reigns King of CollaborationSince COVID-19 forced a large majority of the enterprise workforce into remote work, 72% of companies rolled out at least one new collaboration application. Zoom reigns king with over 50% of enterprises adding the application to their collaboration repertoire, but Microsoft Teams follows closely behind at 43%. Lack of Transparency in Security and GovernanceThe survey found a substantial disconnect between company leadership and lower-level employees related to the security of data and chats. Over 65% of owners, C-Levels, and executives admitted their organization had experienced security incidents related to collaboration or communications, while 83% of entry-level employees were operating with blinders not believing that their company was at risk of a collaboration mishap. Contrary to popular belief, only half of enterprises have implemented heightened governance and security prevention for collaboration applications since moving their workforce to a remote model. ""Even prior to the sudden departure from traditional workspaces, enterprises across the globe were being faced with countless disruptions and concerns regarding governance and security, for collaboration platforms,"" said Scott Gode, Chief Marketing Officer, Unify Square. ""The need for specialized third-party software, coupled with innovative professional services is more crucial than ever before to help highlight blind spots, and implement and enforce policies to minimize data loss risk."" Tech Workers Are Taking the Brunt of the StressIt\'s no surprise that stress levels amongst employees have increased in the wake of the pandemic. Sixty-one percent of technology workers and 63% of c-level employees stated their stress levels have risen since working remotely. Conversely, entry-level employees are able to stay relatively stress-free with only 34% admitting to feeling increased stress. Potential causes of stress include the personal challenges that employees are experiencing while working from home, such as missing the routine of being in the office (43%), collaborating with colleagues in person (41%), distractions at home (35%), and juggling personal duties on top of work (32%). Employers Aren\'t Keen on Fronting the BillGetting a home office up to the standards that employees are used to is a challenge for employers and employees alike. Over half of enterprise workers focusing on IT or Security have had to purchase new equipment or hardware (e.g. monitor, headset, webcam) to facilitate their work from home setup, however, only 12% said their employer helped or paid for it all financially. Even with the correct equipment and hardware, 42% of enterprise employees ages 18-24 years said that it took about a month to get their home-based office setup at the quality that it did when they were in the office. Yet, 40% of those 55 and older said it worked great from day one, which is a surprising comparison from their tech-savvy younger peers who would be expected to have less difficulty with their setup right off the bat. Home Offices Aren\'t All They\'re Cracked Up to BeInterference from pets (48%), someone walking through the background (33%), gardeners/contractors making noise (27%), children making surprise guest appearances (26%), deliveries making noise (26%), power outages (24%), noisy neighbors (21%), and cleaning service vacuuming or cleaning around your workspace (9%) were all noted as culprits for distractions while on a conference call. When the home office wasn\'t quite doing it for them, 22% of those ages 65 and older admitted to taking conference calls from unconventional locations including the closet, in a car, on a boat, in a store, from a child\'s sporting event, and even from the bathroom. Gaps in Productivity PerspectivesPerspectives on remote productivity become a major point of contention among enterprises and their employees. Nearly half of tech workers believe that there is a higher set of standards for productivity within their company since working remotely. The survey unveiled some gaps in perspectives around efficiency across job levels. Forty-four percent of owners, executives, and C-levels believe collaboration with teammates has become much more efficient since moving to a remote model, while only 11% of senior management agree. Yet 44% of employees said their organization has not taken any steps to help facilitate teamwork in a remote environment.

Continue Reading The results of a survey of adults age 60+ conducted by Candoo Tech (www.candootech.com) shows that older adults feel learning a new tech device is more frightening than hearing a strange noise at night, going to the dentist and going to the doctor - combined! Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list. That\'s more than twice the number who want a new tech device, the second choice (21%); which interestingly beat out the ""old school"" gift, a book, by only one percentage point. With COVID-19 travel and visitation restrictions, grandparents are more likely to spend time with family and friends online. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents said they will be visiting virtually through video calls.

TheFBI\'s Internet Crime ComplaintCenter (IC3), received more than 68,000 complaints in 2019 from victims over age 60 who experienced losses of more than $835 million.

This Market Spotlight report covers the Zika virus market, comprising key pipeline therapies, clinical trials, probability of success, epidemiology, and licensing and acquisition deals. Key Takeaways The Zika virus was first reported in continental South America in Brazil in May 2015. In February 2016, between 440,000 and 1,300,000 people were infected in Brazil. In the US, about 225 Zika virus cases were reported in August 2017. In addition, 554 cases were reported in people infected through local mosquito-borne transmission. Furthermore, autochthonous Zika virus transmission was reported in 25 countries in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. In 2016, it was estimated that there were between 508 and 1,778 imported cases in Europe, particularly in France, Portugal, and Italy. The majority of industry-sponsored drugs in active clinical development for Zika virus are in Phase I, with just a single product in Phase II. Therapies in development for Zika virus focus on the immune system, viral antigens, and RNA polymerase. Candidates comprise DNA vaccines such as the National Institutes of Health\'s Zika Virus Vaccine, GeneOne\'s GLS-5700, and Inovio\'s INO-A002; Moderna\'s mRNA vaccine; Themis Bioscience\'s recombinant viral vector vaccine; Imutex\'s AGS-v vaccine; hVIVO\'s AGS-v PLUS vaccine; Johnson & Johnson\'s Ad26.ZIKV.001 vaccine; Takeda\'s TAK-426 vaccine; Emergent BioSolutions\' ZIKV-IG; Valneva\'s VLA 1601; and BioCryst\'s galidesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. The overall likelihood of approval of a Phase I antiviral asset is 14.3%, and the average probability a drug advances from Phase III is 71.3%. Drugs, on average, take 8.7 years from Phase I to approval, compared to 9.1 years in the overall infectious disease space. All clinical trials for Zika virus have been in either Phase I or Phase II, with no Phase III trials to date. The US leads in terms of the number of Zika virus clinical trials globally. Inovio, GeneOne, and Emergent BioSolutions have two completed trials each in the Zika virus space. Inovio leads industry sponsors with four clinical trials for Zika virus, followed by GeneOne, Moderna, and Sanofi.

This Market Spotlight report covers the Zika virus market, comprising key pipeline therapies, clinical trials, probability of success, epidemiology, and licensing and acquisition deals. Key Takeaways The Zika virus was first reported in continental South America in Brazil in May 2015. In February 2016, between 440,000 and 1,300,000 people were infected in Brazil. In the US, about 225 Zika virus cases were reported in August 2017. In addition, 554 cases were reported in people infected through local mosquito-borne transmission. Furthermore, autochthonous Zika virus transmission was reported in 25 countries in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. In 2016, it was estimated that there were between 508 and 1,778 imported cases in Europe, particularly in France, Portugal, and Italy. The majority of industry-sponsored drugs in active clinical development for Zika virus are in Phase I, with just a single product in Phase II. Therapies in development for Zika virus focus on the immune system, viral antigens, and RNA polymerase. Candidates comprise DNA vaccines such as the National Institutes of Health\'s Zika Virus Vaccine, GeneOne\'s GLS-5700, and Inovio\'s INO-A002; Moderna\'s mRNA vaccine; Themis Bioscience\'s recombinant viral vector vaccine; Imutex\'s AGS-v vaccine; hVIVO\'s AGS-v PLUS vaccine; Johnson & Johnson\'s Ad26.ZIKV.001 vaccine; Takeda\'s TAK-426 vaccine; Emergent BioSolutions\' ZIKV-IG; Valneva\'s VLA 1601; and BioCryst\'s galidesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. The overall likelihood of approval of a Phase I antiviral asset is 14.3%, and the average probability a drug advances from Phase III is 71.3%. Drugs, on average, take 8.7 years from Phase I to approval, compared to 9.1 years in the overall infectious disease space. All clinical trials for Zika virus have been in either Phase I or Phase II, with no Phase III trials to date. The US leads in terms of the number of Zika virus clinical trials globally. Inovio, GeneOne, and Emergent BioSolutions have two completed trials each in the Zika virus space. Inovio leads industry sponsors with four clinical trials for Zika virus, followed by GeneOne, Moderna, and Sanofi.

Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list. That\'s more than twice the number who want a new tech device, the second choice (21%); which interestingly beat out the ""old school"" gift, a book, by only one percentage point. With COVID-19 travel and visitation restrictions, grandparents are more likely to spend time with family and friends online. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents said they will be visiting virtually through video calls. While 44% of seniors shopped online for the holidays, 57% are concerned about risks of internet scams, account hacks or computer viruses, and with good reason. TheFBI\'s Internet Crime ComplaintCenter (IC3), received more than 68,000 complaints in 2019 from victims over age 60 who experienced losses of more than $835 million. Only 8% of Candoo Tech survey respondents think they are too smart to fall for a scam. ""Unfortunately, older adults are often prime targets for cyber-criminals, because they are perceived not to be tech savvy,"" said Liz Hamburg, founder and CEO of Candoo Tech. ""One client answered a call from someone posing as a Microsoft technician and let him into her computer remotely. She finally caught on when he demanded to be paid with gift cards, but by then, the damage was done. Helping seniors stay safe online is a priority for Candoo Tech."" Candoo Tech provides tech support and training specifically designed for older adults to help them stay safe, independent and connected. Candoo\'s services are provided remotely nationwide by U.S. based Tech Concierges who are specially-trained by a New York City geriatric health institution, cognitive enrichment specialists and other geriatric experts to work with older adults, including those with disabilities. Candoo Tech offers three service options: a one-hour remote session for $50; an annual membership for $180 which includes two, 90-minute training or support sessions and unlimited quick help; and a new device set-up and training package for $180. The company offers free how-to guides and internet safety tips to help seniors connect, shop and engage safely through technology. The company was founded by entrepreneur Liz Hamburg in 2019 and has been working with older adults and their families directly as well as with senior living facilities and other organizations.

He is one of the most dedicated, hardworking, inspiring athletes I have ever known and I am proud that we have been able to work together for a quarter of a century.

According to the J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Small Business Credit Card Satisfaction Study,SM released today, small business customer satisfaction declines sharply from 2019, regardless of whether those business owners were aware of relief efforts put in place by their card issuers. ""Business credit card customers are broadly aware and appreciative of the relief efforts card issuers have put in place during the pandemic, but it hasnt been enough to outweigh the tough times and strain these businesses are feeling,"" said John Cabell, director of wealth and lending intelligence at J.D. Power. ""This is particularly true among the smallest small businesses. Strategies that are resonating for issuers and small business customers during this challenging time are those that focus on increased communicationparticularly through digital channelsin which issuers offer advice and guidance, community support and late payment forgiveness."" Following are some key findings of the 2020 study: Study Ranking Discover ranks highest in customer satisfaction among national issuers for a second consecutive year, with a score of 867. American Express (861) ranks second and Bank of America (849) ranks third. The J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Small Business Credit Card Satisfaction Study, now in its second year, measures customer satisfaction with the largest small business credit card issuers in the U.S. by examining six factors (in alphabetical order): benefits and services; channel activities; credit card management; credit card terms; key moments; and rewards. The 2020 U.S. Small Business Credit Card Satisfaction Study includes responses from 2,962 small business credit card customers and was fielded in July-August 2020.

Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list.

Continue Reading The results of a survey of adults age 60+ conducted by Candoo Tech (www.candootech.com) shows that older adults feel learning a new tech device is more frightening than hearing a strange noise at night, going to the dentist and going to the doctor - combined! Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list. That\'s more than twice the number who want a new tech device, the second choice (21%); which interestingly beat out the ""old school"" gift, a book, by only one percentage point. With COVID-19 travel and visitation restrictions, grandparents are more likely to spend time with family and friends online. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents said they will be visiting virtually through video calls.

TheFBI\'s Internet Crime ComplaintCenter (IC3), received more than 68,000 complaints in 2019 from victims over age 60 who experienced losses of more than $835 million.

Continue Reading The results of a survey of adults age 60+ conducted by Candoo Tech (www.candootech.com) shows that older adults feel learning a new tech device is more frightening than hearing a strange noise at night, going to the dentist and going to the doctor - combined! Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list. That\'s more than twice the number who want a new tech device, the second choice (21%); which interestingly beat out the ""old school"" gift, a book, by only one percentage point. With COVID-19 travel and visitation restrictions, grandparents are more likely to spend time with family and friends online. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents said they will be visiting virtually through video calls. While 44% of seniors shopped online for the holidays, 57% are concerned about risks of internet scams, account hacks or computer viruses, and with good reason. TheFBI\'s Internet Crime ComplaintCenter (IC3), received more than 68,000 complaints in 2019 from victims over age 60 who experienced losses of more than $835 million. Only 8% of Candoo Tech survey respondents think they are too smart to fall for a scam. ""Unfortunately, older adults are often prime targets for cyber-criminals, because they are perceived not to be tech savvy,"" said Liz Hamburg, founder and CEO of Candoo Tech. ""One client answered a call from someone posing as a Microsoft technician and let him into her computer remotely. She finally caught on when he demanded to be paid with gift cards, but by then, the damage was done. Helping seniors stay safe online is a priority for Candoo Tech."" Candoo Tech provides tech support and training specifically designed for older adults to help them stay safe, independent and connected. Candoo\'s services are provided remotely nationwide by U.S. based Tech Concierges who are specially-trained by a New York City geriatric health institution, cognitive enrichment specialists and other geriatric experts to work with older adults, including those with disabilities.

168,"[269460, 277133]",JNJ,2020-12-04,2020-12-06,"['BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced results of the Phase 3 APOLLO study showing that the addition of DARZALEX (daratumumab) subcutaneous (SC) formulation to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Pd) significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 37 percent, compared to Pd alone in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after the first or subsequent relapse of disease.1 The APOLLO results, which will be presented on Sunday, December 6 at 9:00 p.m. CET during the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting and featured in the ASH press briefing (Abstract #112), add to the body of evidence supporting treatment with daratumumab SC-based regimens for patients with relapsed MM. These data were the basis for recent regulatory submissions in Europe and the United States (U.S.) seeking approval for daratumumab SC in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MM, with two or more prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI).2 For patients with multiple myeloma who relapse, it is important that efficacious treatments significantly reduce the risk of progression. The data presented at ASH makes D-Pd a compelling treatment option for early relapsed or lenalidomide refractory patients, said Meletios A. Dimopoulos, M.D.,* Professor and Chairman of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece, and principal investigator. The APOLLO study also highlights the potential benefits of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, which offers patients and physicians a three- to five-minute injection experience and the potential to reduce infusion-related reactions compared to intravenous administration of daratumumab. Key Findings from the APOLLO Oral Presentation (Abstract #412): The safety profile of D-Pd is consistent with known profiles of daratumumab SC and Pd. The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neutropenia (68% vs. 51%), anaemia (17% vs. 21%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs. 18%), and leukopenia (17% vs. 5%). The most common serious TEAEs were pneumonia (13% vs. 7%) and lower respiratory tract infection (11% vs. 9%).1 Despite much progress over the last decade, multiple myeloma remains a disease with considerable unmet need, with many patients progressing or relapsing on their initial treatment, said Dr Catherine Taylor, VP, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. At Janssen, we continually strive to address the complex needs of these patients and are devoted to pursuing new treatment formulations, such as daratumumab SC, as part of different treatment regimens. We are encouraged by the efficacy of this combination with daratumumab SC, which has improved outcomes over pomalidomide-dexamethasone, a widely used regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have received prior treatment with lenalidomide, said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Together with the reduced infusion time for patients receiving daratumumab SC as compared to the intravenous formulation, the APOLLO study results further solidify this differentiated anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody as a foundational treatment in multiple myeloma for patients who are in need of additional treatment options. *Meletios A. Dimopoulos is lead investigator of the APOLLO study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About the APOLLO Study3 APOLLO (NCT01960348) is an ongoing multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, open-label study comparing daratumumab SC, pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment regimen with both lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression. The study, which was conducted in collaboration with the European Myeloma Network, enrolled 304 participants. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints include rates of overall response rate (ORR), very good partial response (VGPR) or better, complete response (CR) or better and duration of response, among others. The study reinforces findings from the Phase 1b EQUULEUS (MMY1001) trial, which formed the grounds for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of intravenous D-Pd in 2017 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In November 2020, Janssen submitted regulatory applications to the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of the combination of D-Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with 2 prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a PI. About daratumumab and daratumumab SC In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab. Since launch, it is estimated that more than 150,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.4 Daratumumab is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to be given subcutaneously to treat patients with multiple myeloma. Daratumumab SC is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\'s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.5 CD38 is a surface protein that is highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease. Daratumumab SC binds to CD38 and induces myeloma cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), as well as through apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death.6 Data across nine Phase 3 clinical trials in multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) amyloidosis, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that daratumumab-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Additional studies have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of daratumumab SC in the treatment of other malignant and pre-malignant haematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, including smouldering myeloma.16 For further information on daratumumab, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/darzalex. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.17 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.18 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,19,20 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.21 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.22 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.23 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.24 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.25 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past. Were the Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, working tirelessly to make that future a reality for patients everywhere by fighting sickness with science, improving access with ingenuity, and healing hopelessness with heart.

Risk of progression and survival in multiple myeloma relapsing after therapy with IMiDs and bortezomib: a multicenter international myeloma working group study. Leukemia. 2012;26:149-57. CP-195993 December 2020', 'BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today updated results from an ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human dose escalation study (NCT03145181) of teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In heavily pretreated patients, the overall response rate (ORR) with teclistamab was 73 percent (16/22) at the recommended SC Phase 2 dose (RP2D).1 These results for the SC formulation support the recommended dose for the pivotal Phase 2 registration trial, which has started. In addition, updated results for the intravenous (IV) formulation demonstrate the durability of responses.1 The data presented today for the subcutaneous formulation build on promising results presented earlier this year for the intravenous regimen, said Alfred Garfall, M.D.,* Assistant Professor of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, and presenting author. The preliminary efficacy, including durability of responses, combined with the initial safety profile in this highly pretreated population is encouraging and supports further studies of teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are in need of additional treatment options. The study is conducted in two parts: dose escalation (part 1) and dose expansion (part 2), and enrolled patients with MM who had relapsed or were refractory to established therapies and had previously been treated with a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD).1 Patients had received a median of six prior lines of treatment (range, 2-14); 96 percent were triple-class exposed, 81 percent were triple-class refractory, 91 percent were refractory to the last line of therapy, and 39 percent were penta-drug refractory (to two or more immunomodulatory agents, two or more PIs, and an anti-CD38 therapy).1 Prognosis is poor for patients with refractory MM as treatment options are limited.1 The RP2D was identified as 1500 g/kg SC, and the maximum tolerated dose has not been identified. Fifty-five percent of patients achieved a very good partial response or better (12/22), and 23 percent of patients (5/22) achieved a complete response (CR) or better with RP2D SC dosing.1 After median follow-up of 3.9 months (range of 1.77.4 months), 94 percent (15/16) of responders treated with the SC RP2D were alive and progression-free.1 Responses appeared durable and deepened over time at the RP2D.1 Of the 11 patients who achieved CR and were evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis across all IV and SC doses, eight patients attained MRD-negative CR at a threshold of 10-6 and one at a 10-5 threshold. Sustained MRD-negativity was confirmed for all five evaluable patients across the IV and SC cohorts.1 At the SC RP2D, 64 percent of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events, all of which were Grade 1 or 2 and generally confined to step-up, or a gradual increase in dosing, and first full doses.1 No patients discontinued treatment due to CRS. Of 33 treated patients at the RP2D, only one neurotoxicity event, which was reversible, was observed.1 Selection of the 1500ug/kg SC RP2D is supported by promising safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The SC formulation may provide an opportunity for less frequent dosing for patients than the IV formulation, although this has not been explored in the current study.1 The most common adverse events (AEs) (all grade 20 percent) for the RP2D in the SC cohort were CRS (64 percent); neutropenia (52 percent); anaemia (39 percent); thrombocytopenia (33 percent); leukopenia (33 percent); and fatigue (24 percent).1 In patients who experienced Grade 3 and above AEs (20 percent), the most common at the RP2D SC dose were neutropenia (33 percent); and anaemia (21 percent).1 One Grade 5 treatment related AE (pneumonia) was reported at the 80 g/kg IV dose, but none at the RP2D.1 We are committed to exploring treatment options that use promising modalities in multiple myeloma, including bispecific antibodies like teclistamab, that increase treatment responses through antigen targeting, said Yusri Elsayed, M.D., M.HSc., Ph.D., Vice President, Global Head, Hematologic Malignancies, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Our research in multiple myeloma is broad, exploring multiple targets through a variety of approaches. We continue to identify new treatment options, particularly for patients who have relapsed or become refractory to existing therapies. These initial results demonstrate the early promise of bispecific antibodies for people living with multiple myeloma and may, in the future, provide healthcare professionals with another tool in their arsenal to treat this devastating disease. said Dr Catherine Taylor, Vice President, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. Their development builds on our rich heritage in multiple myeloma, where we have continually sought to investigate new treatment strategies that have the potential to address remaining unmet needs. Additional pharmacokinetic and ex vivo data for teclistamab will be highlighted in a poster on Monday, December 7 from 4:00pm to 12:30am CET (Abstract #3194).2 This study evaluated the ability of teclistamab to induce cytotoxicity and T-cell activation.2 *Alfred Garfall is lead investigator of the NCT03145181 study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About Teclistamab Teclistamab is an investigational bispecific antibody targeting both B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD3. BCMA is expressed at high levels on multiple myeloma cells.3,4,5,6,7 Teclistamab redirects CD3-positive T-cells to BCMA-expressing myeloma cells to induce cytotoxicity of the targeted cells.5,6 Results from preclinical studies demonstrate that teclistamab kills myeloma cell lines and bone marrow-derived myeloma cells from heavily pretreated patients.6 Teclistamab is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (NCT04557098) and is also being explored in combination studies (NCT04586426, NCT04108195). The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.\'s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBodytechnology platform.** InOctober and November 2020, the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), respectively, granted teclistamab orphan designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma.8,9 **DuoBody is a registered trademark of Genmab A/S. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.10 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.11 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,12,13 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.14 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.15 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.16 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.17 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.18 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

170,"[269460, 277133]",JNJ,2020-12-04,2020-12-06,"['BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced results of the Phase 3 APOLLO study showing that the addition of DARZALEX (daratumumab) subcutaneous (SC) formulation to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Pd) significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 37 percent, compared to Pd alone in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after the first or subsequent relapse of disease.1 The APOLLO results, which will be presented on Sunday, December 6 at 9:00 p.m. CET during the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting and featured in the ASH press briefing (Abstract #112), add to the body of evidence supporting treatment with daratumumab SC-based regimens for patients with relapsed MM. These data were the basis for recent regulatory submissions in Europe and the United States (U.S.) seeking approval for daratumumab SC in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MM, with two or more prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI).2 For patients with multiple myeloma who relapse, it is important that efficacious treatments significantly reduce the risk of progression. The data presented at ASH makes D-Pd a compelling treatment option for early relapsed or lenalidomide refractory patients, said Meletios A. Dimopoulos, M.D.,* Professor and Chairman of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece, and principal investigator. The APOLLO study also highlights the potential benefits of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, which offers patients and physicians a three- to five-minute injection experience and the potential to reduce infusion-related reactions compared to intravenous administration of daratumumab. Key Findings from the APOLLO Oral Presentation (Abstract #412): The safety profile of D-Pd is consistent with known profiles of daratumumab SC and Pd. The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neutropenia (68% vs. 51%), anaemia (17% vs. 21%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs. 18%), and leukopenia (17% vs. 5%). The most common serious TEAEs were pneumonia (13% vs. 7%) and lower respiratory tract infection (11% vs. 9%).1 Despite much progress over the last decade, multiple myeloma remains a disease with considerable unmet need, with many patients progressing or relapsing on their initial treatment, said Dr Catherine Taylor, VP, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. At Janssen, we continually strive to address the complex needs of these patients and are devoted to pursuing new treatment formulations, such as daratumumab SC, as part of different treatment regimens. We are encouraged by the efficacy of this combination with daratumumab SC, which has improved outcomes over pomalidomide-dexamethasone, a widely used regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have received prior treatment with lenalidomide, said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Together with the reduced infusion time for patients receiving daratumumab SC as compared to the intravenous formulation, the APOLLO study results further solidify this differentiated anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody as a foundational treatment in multiple myeloma for patients who are in need of additional treatment options. *Meletios A. Dimopoulos is lead investigator of the APOLLO study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About the APOLLO Study3 APOLLO (NCT01960348) is an ongoing multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, open-label study comparing daratumumab SC, pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment regimen with both lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression. The study, which was conducted in collaboration with the European Myeloma Network, enrolled 304 participants. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints include rates of overall response rate (ORR), very good partial response (VGPR) or better, complete response (CR) or better and duration of response, among others. The study reinforces findings from the Phase 1b EQUULEUS (MMY1001) trial, which formed the grounds for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of intravenous D-Pd in 2017 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In November 2020, Janssen submitted regulatory applications to the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of the combination of D-Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with 2 prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a PI. About daratumumab and daratumumab SC In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab. Since launch, it is estimated that more than 150,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.4 Daratumumab is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to be given subcutaneously to treat patients with multiple myeloma. Daratumumab SC is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\'s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.5 CD38 is a surface protein that is highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease. Daratumumab SC binds to CD38 and induces myeloma cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), as well as through apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death.6 Data across nine Phase 3 clinical trials in multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) amyloidosis, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that daratumumab-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Additional studies have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of daratumumab SC in the treatment of other malignant and pre-malignant haematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, including smouldering myeloma.16 For further information on daratumumab, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/darzalex. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.17 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.18 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,19,20 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.21 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.22 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.23 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.24 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.25 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

CP-195993 December 2020', 'BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today updated results from an ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human dose escalation study (NCT03145181) of teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In heavily pretreated patients, the overall response rate (ORR) with teclistamab was 73 percent (16/22) at the recommended SC Phase 2 dose (RP2D).1 These results for the SC formulation support the recommended dose for the pivotal Phase 2 registration trial, which has started. In addition, updated results for the intravenous (IV) formulation demonstrate the durability of responses.1 The data presented today for the subcutaneous formulation build on promising results presented earlier this year for the intravenous regimen, said Alfred Garfall, M.D.,* Assistant Professor of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, and presenting author. The preliminary efficacy, including durability of responses, combined with the initial safety profile in this highly pretreated population is encouraging and supports further studies of teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are in need of additional treatment options. The study is conducted in two parts: dose escalation (part 1) and dose expansion (part 2), and enrolled patients with MM who had relapsed or were refractory to established therapies and had previously been treated with a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD).1 Patients had received a median of six prior lines of treatment (range, 2-14); 96 percent were triple-class exposed, 81 percent were triple-class refractory, 91 percent were refractory to the last line of therapy, and 39 percent were penta-drug refractory (to two or more immunomodulatory agents, two or more PIs, and an anti-CD38 therapy).1 Prognosis is poor for patients with refractory MM as treatment options are limited.1 The RP2D was identified as 1500 g/kg SC, and the maximum tolerated dose has not been identified. Fifty-five percent of patients achieved a very good partial response or better (12/22), and 23 percent of patients (5/22) achieved a complete response (CR) or better with RP2D SC dosing.1 After median follow-up of 3.9 months (range of 1.77.4 months), 94 percent (15/16) of responders treated with the SC RP2D were alive and progression-free.1 Responses appeared durable and deepened over time at the RP2D.1 Of the 11 patients who achieved CR and were evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis across all IV and SC doses, eight patients attained MRD-negative CR at a threshold of 10-6 and one at a 10-5 threshold. Sustained MRD-negativity was confirmed for all five evaluable patients across the IV and SC cohorts.1 At the SC RP2D, 64 percent of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events, all of which were Grade 1 or 2 and generally confined to step-up, or a gradual increase in dosing, and first full doses.1 No patients discontinued treatment due to CRS. Of 33 treated patients at the RP2D, only one neurotoxicity event, which was reversible, was observed.1 Selection of the 1500ug/kg SC RP2D is supported by promising safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The SC formulation may provide an opportunity for less frequent dosing for patients than the IV formulation, although this has not been explored in the current study.1 The most common adverse events (AEs) (all grade 20 percent) for the RP2D in the SC cohort were CRS (64 percent); neutropenia (52 percent); anaemia (39 percent); thrombocytopenia (33 percent); leukopenia (33 percent); and fatigue (24 percent).1 In patients who experienced Grade 3 and above AEs (20 percent), the most common at the RP2D SC dose were neutropenia (33 percent); and anaemia (21 percent).1 One Grade 5 treatment related AE (pneumonia) was reported at the 80 g/kg IV dose, but none at the RP2D.1 We are committed to exploring treatment options that use promising modalities in multiple myeloma, including bispecific antibodies like teclistamab, that increase treatment responses through antigen targeting, said Yusri Elsayed, M.D., M.HSc., Ph.D., Vice President, Global Head, Hematologic Malignancies, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Our research in multiple myeloma is broad, exploring multiple targets through a variety of approaches. We continue to identify new treatment options, particularly for patients who have relapsed or become refractory to existing therapies. These initial results demonstrate the early promise of bispecific antibodies for people living with multiple myeloma and may, in the future, provide healthcare professionals with another tool in their arsenal to treat this devastating disease. said Dr Catherine Taylor, Vice President, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. Their development builds on our rich heritage in multiple myeloma, where we have continually sought to investigate new treatment strategies that have the potential to address remaining unmet needs. Additional pharmacokinetic and ex vivo data for teclistamab will be highlighted in a poster on Monday, December 7 from 4:00pm to 12:30am CET (Abstract #3194).2 This study evaluated the ability of teclistamab to induce cytotoxicity and T-cell activation.2 *Alfred Garfall is lead investigator of the NCT03145181 study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About Teclistamab Teclistamab is an investigational bispecific antibody targeting both B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD3. BCMA is expressed at high levels on multiple myeloma cells.3,4,5,6,7 Teclistamab redirects CD3-positive T-cells to BCMA-expressing myeloma cells to induce cytotoxicity of the targeted cells.5,6 Results from preclinical studies demonstrate that teclistamab kills myeloma cell lines and bone marrow-derived myeloma cells from heavily pretreated patients.6 Teclistamab is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (NCT04557098) and is also being explored in combination studies (NCT04586426, NCT04108195). The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.\'s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBodytechnology platform.** InOctober and November 2020, the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), respectively, granted teclistamab orphan designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma.8,9 **DuoBody is a registered trademark of Genmab A/S. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.10 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.11 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,12,13 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.14 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.15 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.16 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.17 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.18 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past. Were the Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, working tirelessly to make that future a reality for patients everywhere by fighting sickness with science, improving access with ingenuity, and healing hopelessness with heart.

171,"[269460, 277133]",JNJ,2020-12-04,2020-12-06,"['BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced results of the Phase 3 APOLLO study showing that the addition of DARZALEX (daratumumab) subcutaneous (SC) formulation to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Pd) significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 37 percent, compared to Pd alone in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after the first or subsequent relapse of disease.1 The APOLLO results, which will be presented on Sunday, December 6 at 9:00 p.m. CET during the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting and featured in the ASH press briefing (Abstract #112), add to the body of evidence supporting treatment with daratumumab SC-based regimens for patients with relapsed MM. These data were the basis for recent regulatory submissions in Europe and the United States (U.S.) seeking approval for daratumumab SC in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MM, with two or more prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI).2 For patients with multiple myeloma who relapse, it is important that efficacious treatments significantly reduce the risk of progression. The data presented at ASH makes D-Pd a compelling treatment option for early relapsed or lenalidomide refractory patients, said Meletios A. Dimopoulos, M.D.,* Professor and Chairman of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece, and principal investigator. The APOLLO study also highlights the potential benefits of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, which offers patients and physicians a three- to five-minute injection experience and the potential to reduce infusion-related reactions compared to intravenous administration of daratumumab. Key Findings from the APOLLO Oral Presentation (Abstract #412): The safety profile of D-Pd is consistent with known profiles of daratumumab SC and Pd. The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neutropenia (68% vs. 51%), anaemia (17% vs. 21%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs. 18%), and leukopenia (17% vs. 5%). The most common serious TEAEs were pneumonia (13% vs. 7%) and lower respiratory tract infection (11% vs. 9%).1 Despite much progress over the last decade, multiple myeloma remains a disease with considerable unmet need, with many patients progressing or relapsing on their initial treatment, said Dr Catherine Taylor, VP, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. At Janssen, we continually strive to address the complex needs of these patients and are devoted to pursuing new treatment formulations, such as daratumumab SC, as part of different treatment regimens. We are encouraged by the efficacy of this combination with daratumumab SC, which has improved outcomes over pomalidomide-dexamethasone, a widely used regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have received prior treatment with lenalidomide, said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Together with the reduced infusion time for patients receiving daratumumab SC as compared to the intravenous formulation, the APOLLO study results further solidify this differentiated anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody as a foundational treatment in multiple myeloma for patients who are in need of additional treatment options. *Meletios A. Dimopoulos is lead investigator of the APOLLO study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About the APOLLO Study3 APOLLO (NCT01960348) is an ongoing multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, open-label study comparing daratumumab SC, pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment regimen with both lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression. The study, which was conducted in collaboration with the European Myeloma Network, enrolled 304 participants. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints include rates of overall response rate (ORR), very good partial response (VGPR) or better, complete response (CR) or better and duration of response, among others. The study reinforces findings from the Phase 1b EQUULEUS (MMY1001) trial, which formed the grounds for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of intravenous D-Pd in 2017 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In November 2020, Janssen submitted regulatory applications to the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of the combination of D-Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with 2 prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a PI. About daratumumab and daratumumab SC In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab. Since launch, it is estimated that more than 150,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.4 Daratumumab is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to be given subcutaneously to treat patients with multiple myeloma. Daratumumab SC is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\'s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.5 CD38 is a surface protein that is highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease. Daratumumab SC binds to CD38 and induces myeloma cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), as well as through apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death.6 Data across nine Phase 3 clinical trials in multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) amyloidosis, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that daratumumab-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Additional studies have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of daratumumab SC in the treatment of other malignant and pre-malignant haematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, including smouldering myeloma.16 For further information on daratumumab, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/darzalex. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.17 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.18 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,19,20 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.21 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.22 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.23 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.24 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.25 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past. Were the Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, working tirelessly to make that future a reality for patients everywhere by fighting sickness with science, improving access with ingenuity, and healing hopelessness with heart.

CP-195993 December 2020', 'BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today updated results from an ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human dose escalation study (NCT03145181) of teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In heavily pretreated patients, the overall response rate (ORR) with teclistamab was 73 percent (16/22) at the recommended SC Phase 2 dose (RP2D).1 These results for the SC formulation support the recommended dose for the pivotal Phase 2 registration trial, which has started. In addition, updated results for the intravenous (IV) formulation demonstrate the durability of responses.1 The data presented today for the subcutaneous formulation build on promising results presented earlier this year for the intravenous regimen, said Alfred Garfall, M.D.,* Assistant Professor of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, and presenting author. The preliminary efficacy, including durability of responses, combined with the initial safety profile in this highly pretreated population is encouraging and supports further studies of teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are in need of additional treatment options. The study is conducted in two parts: dose escalation (part 1) and dose expansion (part 2), and enrolled patients with MM who had relapsed or were refractory to established therapies and had previously been treated with a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD).1 Patients had received a median of six prior lines of treatment (range, 2-14); 96 percent were triple-class exposed, 81 percent were triple-class refractory, 91 percent were refractory to the last line of therapy, and 39 percent were penta-drug refractory (to two or more immunomodulatory agents, two or more PIs, and an anti-CD38 therapy).1 Prognosis is poor for patients with refractory MM as treatment options are limited.1 The RP2D was identified as 1500 g/kg SC, and the maximum tolerated dose has not been identified. Fifty-five percent of patients achieved a very good partial response or better (12/22), and 23 percent of patients (5/22) achieved a complete response (CR) or better with RP2D SC dosing.1 After median follow-up of 3.9 months (range of 1.77.4 months), 94 percent (15/16) of responders treated with the SC RP2D were alive and progression-free.1 Responses appeared durable and deepened over time at the RP2D.1 Of the 11 patients who achieved CR and were evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis across all IV and SC doses, eight patients attained MRD-negative CR at a threshold of 10-6 and one at a 10-5 threshold. Sustained MRD-negativity was confirmed for all five evaluable patients across the IV and SC cohorts.1 At the SC RP2D, 64 percent of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events, all of which were Grade 1 or 2 and generally confined to step-up, or a gradual increase in dosing, and first full doses.1 No patients discontinued treatment due to CRS. Of 33 treated patients at the RP2D, only one neurotoxicity event, which was reversible, was observed.1 Selection of the 1500ug/kg SC RP2D is supported by promising safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The SC formulation may provide an opportunity for less frequent dosing for patients than the IV formulation, although this has not been explored in the current study.1 The most common adverse events (AEs) (all grade 20 percent) for the RP2D in the SC cohort were CRS (64 percent); neutropenia (52 percent); anaemia (39 percent); thrombocytopenia (33 percent); leukopenia (33 percent); and fatigue (24 percent).1 In patients who experienced Grade 3 and above AEs (20 percent), the most common at the RP2D SC dose were neutropenia (33 percent); and anaemia (21 percent).1 One Grade 5 treatment related AE (pneumonia) was reported at the 80 g/kg IV dose, but none at the RP2D.1 We are committed to exploring treatment options that use promising modalities in multiple myeloma, including bispecific antibodies like teclistamab, that increase treatment responses through antigen targeting, said Yusri Elsayed, M.D., M.HSc., Ph.D., Vice President, Global Head, Hematologic Malignancies, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Our research in multiple myeloma is broad, exploring multiple targets through a variety of approaches. We continue to identify new treatment options, particularly for patients who have relapsed or become refractory to existing therapies. These initial results demonstrate the early promise of bispecific antibodies for people living with multiple myeloma and may, in the future, provide healthcare professionals with another tool in their arsenal to treat this devastating disease. said Dr Catherine Taylor, Vice President, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. Their development builds on our rich heritage in multiple myeloma, where we have continually sought to investigate new treatment strategies that have the potential to address remaining unmet needs. Additional pharmacokinetic and ex vivo data for teclistamab will be highlighted in a poster on Monday, December 7 from 4:00pm to 12:30am CET (Abstract #3194).2 This study evaluated the ability of teclistamab to induce cytotoxicity and T-cell activation.2 *Alfred Garfall is lead investigator of the NCT03145181 study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About Teclistamab Teclistamab is an investigational bispecific antibody targeting both B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD3. BCMA is expressed at high levels on multiple myeloma cells.3,4,5,6,7 Teclistamab redirects CD3-positive T-cells to BCMA-expressing myeloma cells to induce cytotoxicity of the targeted cells.5,6 Results from preclinical studies demonstrate that teclistamab kills myeloma cell lines and bone marrow-derived myeloma cells from heavily pretreated patients.6 Teclistamab is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (NCT04557098) and is also being explored in combination studies (NCT04586426, NCT04108195). The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.\'s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBodytechnology platform.** InOctober and November 2020, the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), respectively, granted teclistamab orphan designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma.8,9 **DuoBody is a registered trademark of Genmab A/S. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.10 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.11 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,12,13 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.14 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.15 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.16 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.17 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.18 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

Continue Reading The results of a survey of adults age 60+ conducted by Candoo Tech (www.candootech.com) shows that older adults feel learning a new tech device is more frightening than hearing a strange noise at night, going to the dentist and going to the doctor - combined! Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list. That\'s more than twice the number who want a new tech device, the second choice (21%); which interestingly beat out the ""old school"" gift, a book, by only one percentage point. With COVID-19 travel and visitation restrictions, grandparents are more likely to spend time with family and friends online. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents said they will be visiting virtually through video calls. While 44% of seniors shopped online for the holidays, 57% are concerned about risks of internet scams, account hacks or computer viruses, and with good reason. TheFBI\'s Internet Crime ComplaintCenter (IC3), received more than 68,000 complaints in 2019 from victims over age 60 who experienced losses of more than $835 million. Only 8% of Candoo Tech survey respondents think they are too smart to fall for a scam. ""Unfortunately, older adults are often prime targets for cyber-criminals, because they are perceived not to be tech savvy,"" said Liz Hamburg, founder and CEO of Candoo Tech. ""One client answered a call from someone posing as a Microsoft technician and let him into her computer remotely. She finally caught on when he demanded to be paid with gift cards, but by then, the damage was done. Helping seniors stay safe online is a priority for Candoo Tech."" Candoo Tech provides tech support and training specifically designed for older adults to help them stay safe, independent and connected. Candoo\'s services are provided remotely nationwide by U.S. based Tech Concierges who are specially-trained by a New York City geriatric health institution, cognitive enrichment specialists and other geriatric experts to work with older adults, including those with disabilities. Candoo Tech offers three service options: a one-hour remote session for $50; an annual membership for $180 which includes two, 90-minute training or support sessions and unlimited quick help; and a new device set-up and training package for $180. The company offers free how-to guides and internet safety tips to help seniors connect, shop and engage safely through technology.

Continue Reading The results of a survey of adults age 60+ conducted by Candoo Tech (www.candootech.com) shows that older adults feel learning a new tech device is more frightening than hearing a strange noise at night, going to the dentist and going to the doctor - combined! Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list. That\'s more than twice the number who want a new tech device, the second choice (21%); which interestingly beat out the ""old school"" gift, a book, by only one percentage point. With COVID-19 travel and visitation restrictions, grandparents are more likely to spend time with family and friends online. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents said they will be visiting virtually through video calls. While 44% of seniors shopped online for the holidays, 57% are concerned about risks of internet scams, account hacks or computer viruses, and with good reason. TheFBI\'s Internet Crime ComplaintCenter (IC3), received more than 68,000 complaints in 2019 from victims over age 60 who experienced losses of more than $835 million. Only 8% of Candoo Tech survey respondents think they are too smart to fall for a scam. ""Unfortunately, older adults are often prime targets for cyber-criminals, because they are perceived not to be tech savvy,"" said Liz Hamburg, founder and CEO of Candoo Tech. ""One client answered a call from someone posing as a Microsoft technician and let him into her computer remotely. She finally caught on when he demanded to be paid with gift cards, but by then, the damage was done. Helping seniors stay safe online is a priority for Candoo Tech."" Candoo Tech provides tech support and training specifically designed for older adults to help them stay safe, independent and connected. Candoo\'s services are provided remotely nationwide by U.S. based Tech Concierges who are specially-trained by a New York City geriatric health institution, cognitive enrichment specialists and other geriatric experts to work with older adults, including those with disabilities. Candoo Tech offers three service options: a one-hour remote session for $50; an annual membership for $180 which includes two, 90-minute training or support sessions and unlimited quick help; and a new device set-up and training package for $180. The company offers free how-to guides and internet safety tips to help seniors connect, shop and engage safely through technology. The company was founded by entrepreneur Liz Hamburg in 2019 and has been working with older adults and their families directly as well as with senior living facilities and other organizations. Candoo has seen that with the proper training and support, older adults realize that they \'candoo it\'.""

189,"[269460, 277133]",JNJ,2020-12-04,2020-12-06,"['BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced results of the Phase 3 APOLLO study showing that the addition of DARZALEX (daratumumab) subcutaneous (SC) formulation to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Pd) significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 37 percent, compared to Pd alone in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after the first or subsequent relapse of disease.1 The APOLLO results, which will be presented on Sunday, December 6 at 9:00 p.m. CET during the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 Annual Meeting and featured in the ASH press briefing (Abstract #112), add to the body of evidence supporting treatment with daratumumab SC-based regimens for patients with relapsed MM. These data were the basis for recent regulatory submissions in Europe and the United States (U.S.) seeking approval for daratumumab SC in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MM, with two or more prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI).2 For patients with multiple myeloma who relapse, it is important that efficacious treatments significantly reduce the risk of progression. The data presented at ASH makes D-Pd a compelling treatment option for early relapsed or lenalidomide refractory patients, said Meletios A. Dimopoulos, M.D.,* Professor and Chairman of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece, and principal investigator. The APOLLO study also highlights the potential benefits of the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, which offers patients and physicians a three- to five-minute injection experience and the potential to reduce infusion-related reactions compared to intravenous administration of daratumumab. Key Findings from the APOLLO Oral Presentation (Abstract #412): The safety profile of D-Pd is consistent with known profiles of daratumumab SC and Pd. The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neutropenia (68% vs. 51%), anaemia (17% vs. 21%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs. 18%), and leukopenia (17% vs. 5%). The most common serious TEAEs were pneumonia (13% vs. 7%) and lower respiratory tract infection (11% vs. 9%).1 Despite much progress over the last decade, multiple myeloma remains a disease with considerable unmet need, with many patients progressing or relapsing on their initial treatment, said Dr Catherine Taylor, VP, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. At Janssen, we continually strive to address the complex needs of these patients and are devoted to pursuing new treatment formulations, such as daratumumab SC, as part of different treatment regimens. We are encouraged by the efficacy of this combination with daratumumab SC, which has improved outcomes over pomalidomide-dexamethasone, a widely used regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have received prior treatment with lenalidomide, said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Late Development and Global Medical Affairs, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Together with the reduced infusion time for patients receiving daratumumab SC as compared to the intravenous formulation, the APOLLO study results further solidify this differentiated anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody as a foundational treatment in multiple myeloma for patients who are in need of additional treatment options. *Meletios A. Dimopoulos is lead investigator of the APOLLO study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About the APOLLO Study3 APOLLO (NCT01960348) is an ongoing multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, open-label study comparing daratumumab SC, pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment regimen with both lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression. The study, which was conducted in collaboration with the European Myeloma Network, enrolled 304 participants. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints include rates of overall response rate (ORR), very good partial response (VGPR) or better, complete response (CR) or better and duration of response, among others. The study reinforces findings from the Phase 1b EQUULEUS (MMY1001) trial, which formed the grounds for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of intravenous D-Pd in 2017 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In November 2020, Janssen submitted regulatory applications to the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of the combination of D-Pd for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with 2 prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a PI. About daratumumab and daratumumab SC In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab. Since launch, it is estimated that more than 150,000 patients have been treated with daratumumab worldwide.4 Daratumumab is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to be given subcutaneously to treat patients with multiple myeloma. Daratumumab SC is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\'s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.5 CD38 is a surface protein that is highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease. Daratumumab SC binds to CD38 and induces myeloma cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), as well as through apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death.6 Data across nine Phase 3 clinical trials in multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) amyloidosis, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that daratumumab-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Additional studies have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of daratumumab SC in the treatment of other malignant and pre-malignant haematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, including smouldering myeloma.16 For further information on daratumumab, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/darzalex. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.17 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.18 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,19,20 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.21 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.22 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.23 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.24 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.25 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past. Were the Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, working tirelessly to make that future a reality for patients everywhere by fighting sickness with science, improving access with ingenuity, and healing hopelessness with heart.

CP-195993 December 2020', 'BEERSE, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today updated results from an ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human dose escalation study (NCT03145181) of teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In heavily pretreated patients, the overall response rate (ORR) with teclistamab was 73 percent (16/22) at the recommended SC Phase 2 dose (RP2D).1 These results for the SC formulation support the recommended dose for the pivotal Phase 2 registration trial, which has started. In addition, updated results for the intravenous (IV) formulation demonstrate the durability of responses.1 The data presented today for the subcutaneous formulation build on promising results presented earlier this year for the intravenous regimen, said Alfred Garfall, M.D.,* Assistant Professor of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, and presenting author. The preliminary efficacy, including durability of responses, combined with the initial safety profile in this highly pretreated population is encouraging and supports further studies of teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are in need of additional treatment options. The study is conducted in two parts: dose escalation (part 1) and dose expansion (part 2), and enrolled patients with MM who had relapsed or were refractory to established therapies and had previously been treated with a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD).1 Patients had received a median of six prior lines of treatment (range, 2-14); 96 percent were triple-class exposed, 81 percent were triple-class refractory, 91 percent were refractory to the last line of therapy, and 39 percent were penta-drug refractory (to two or more immunomodulatory agents, two or more PIs, and an anti-CD38 therapy).1 Prognosis is poor for patients with refractory MM as treatment options are limited.1 The RP2D was identified as 1500 g/kg SC, and the maximum tolerated dose has not been identified. Fifty-five percent of patients achieved a very good partial response or better (12/22), and 23 percent of patients (5/22) achieved a complete response (CR) or better with RP2D SC dosing.1 After median follow-up of 3.9 months (range of 1.77.4 months), 94 percent (15/16) of responders treated with the SC RP2D were alive and progression-free.1 Responses appeared durable and deepened over time at the RP2D.1 Of the 11 patients who achieved CR and were evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis across all IV and SC doses, eight patients attained MRD-negative CR at a threshold of 10-6 and one at a 10-5 threshold. Sustained MRD-negativity was confirmed for all five evaluable patients across the IV and SC cohorts.1 At the SC RP2D, 64 percent of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events, all of which were Grade 1 or 2 and generally confined to step-up, or a gradual increase in dosing, and first full doses.1 No patients discontinued treatment due to CRS. Of 33 treated patients at the RP2D, only one neurotoxicity event, which was reversible, was observed.1 Selection of the 1500ug/kg SC RP2D is supported by promising safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The SC formulation may provide an opportunity for less frequent dosing for patients than the IV formulation, although this has not been explored in the current study.1 The most common adverse events (AEs) (all grade 20 percent) for the RP2D in the SC cohort were CRS (64 percent); neutropenia (52 percent); anaemia (39 percent); thrombocytopenia (33 percent); leukopenia (33 percent); and fatigue (24 percent).1 In patients who experienced Grade 3 and above AEs (20 percent), the most common at the RP2D SC dose were neutropenia (33 percent); and anaemia (21 percent).1 One Grade 5 treatment related AE (pneumonia) was reported at the 80 g/kg IV dose, but none at the RP2D.1 We are committed to exploring treatment options that use promising modalities in multiple myeloma, including bispecific antibodies like teclistamab, that increase treatment responses through antigen targeting, said Yusri Elsayed, M.D., M.HSc., Ph.D., Vice President, Global Head, Hematologic Malignancies, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. Our research in multiple myeloma is broad, exploring multiple targets through a variety of approaches. We continue to identify new treatment options, particularly for patients who have relapsed or become refractory to existing therapies. These initial results demonstrate the early promise of bispecific antibodies for people living with multiple myeloma and may, in the future, provide healthcare professionals with another tool in their arsenal to treat this devastating disease. said Dr Catherine Taylor, Vice President, Medical Affairs Therapeutic Area Strategy, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Middle East. Their development builds on our rich heritage in multiple myeloma, where we have continually sought to investigate new treatment strategies that have the potential to address remaining unmet needs. Additional pharmacokinetic and ex vivo data for teclistamab will be highlighted in a poster on Monday, December 7 from 4:00pm to 12:30am CET (Abstract #3194).2 This study evaluated the ability of teclistamab to induce cytotoxicity and T-cell activation.2 *Alfred Garfall is lead investigator of the NCT03145181 study and was not compensated for any media work #ENDS# About Teclistamab Teclistamab is an investigational bispecific antibody targeting both B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD3. BCMA is expressed at high levels on multiple myeloma cells.3,4,5,6,7 Teclistamab redirects CD3-positive T-cells to BCMA-expressing myeloma cells to induce cytotoxicity of the targeted cells.5,6 Results from preclinical studies demonstrate that teclistamab kills myeloma cell lines and bone marrow-derived myeloma cells from heavily pretreated patients.6 Teclistamab is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (NCT04557098) and is also being explored in combination studies (NCT04586426, NCT04108195). The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen Biotech, Inc.\'s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBodytechnology platform.** InOctober and November 2020, the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), respectively, granted teclistamab orphan designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma.8,9 **DuoBody is a registered trademark of Genmab A/S. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.10 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.11 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,12,13 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.14 Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.15 Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.16 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.17 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.18 About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson At Janssen, were creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

190,[84746],MSFT,2020-12-18,2020-12-20,"['NEW YORK, Dec. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The results of a recent survey of technology-enabled older adults show that for 53% of them, learning new tech devices such as a computer or cellphone, produced more anxiety and fear than going to the dentist, to the doctor and hearing a strange noise at night combined! Continue Reading The results of a survey of adults age 60+ conducted by Candoo Tech (www.candootech.com) shows that older adults feel learning a new tech device is more frightening than hearing a strange noise at night, going to the dentist and going to the doctor - combined! Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list. That\'s more than twice the number who want a new tech device, the second choice (21%); which interestingly beat out the ""old school"" gift, a book, by only one percentage point. With COVID-19 travel and visitation restrictions, grandparents are more likely to spend time with family and friends online. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents said they will be visiting virtually through video calls. While 44% of seniors shopped online for the holidays, 57% are concerned about risks of internet scams, account hacks or computer viruses, and with good reason. TheFBI\'s Internet Crime ComplaintCenter (IC3), received more than 68,000 complaints in 2019 from victims over age 60 who experienced losses of more than $835 million. Only 8% of Candoo Tech survey respondents think they are too smart to fall for a scam. ""Unfortunately, older adults are often prime targets for cyber-criminals, because they are perceived not to be tech savvy,"" said Liz Hamburg, founder and CEO of Candoo Tech. ""One client answered a call from someone posing as a Microsoft technician and let him into her computer remotely. She finally caught on when he demanded to be paid with gift cards, but by then, the damage was done. Helping seniors stay safe online is a priority for Candoo Tech."" Candoo Tech provides tech support and training specifically designed for older adults to help them stay safe, independent and connected. Candoo\'s services are provided remotely nationwide by U.S. based Tech Concierges who are specially-trained by a New York City geriatric health institution, cognitive enrichment specialists and other geriatric experts to work with older adults, including those with disabilities. Candoo Tech offers three service options: a one-hour remote session for $50; an annual membership for $180 which includes two, 90-minute training or support sessions and unlimited quick help; and a new device set-up and training package for $180. The company offers free how-to guides and internet safety tips to help seniors connect, shop and engage safely through technology. The company was founded by entrepreneur Liz Hamburg in 2019 and has been working with older adults and their families directly as well as with senior living facilities and other organizations. Candoo has seen that with the proper training and support, older adults realize that they \'candoo it\'."" Candoo Tech is a proud member of the inaugural class of Techstars Future of Longevity Accelerator in partnership with Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company created by Melinda Gates.

Continue Reading The results of a survey of adults age 60+ conducted by Candoo Tech (www.candootech.com) shows that older adults feel learning a new tech device is more frightening than hearing a strange noise at night, going to the dentist and going to the doctor - combined! Fifty-seven percent of seniors fear internet scams, hacks and computer viruses. When giving the grandparents a gift, skip the books and slippers, older folks really want a personal tech coach. The informal poll taken by Candoo Tech, a technology training and support service specifically for older adults, also asked participants to rank their frustration level with learning something new on an electronic device. Respondents ranked it right up there with waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau, and more frustrating that being stuck in traffic. Despite their fear and frustration, seniors want to be connected. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents picked ""personal tech coach"" as the number one item on their wish list. That\'s more than twice the number who want a new tech device, the second choice (21%); which interestingly beat out the ""old school"" gift, a book, by only one percentage point. With COVID-19 travel and visitation restrictions, grandparents are more likely to spend time with family and friends online. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of respondents said they will be visiting virtually through video calls. While 44% of seniors shopped online for the holidays, 57% are concerned about risks of internet scams, account hacks or computer viruses, and with good reason. TheFBI\'s Internet Crime ComplaintCenter (IC3), received more than 68,000 complaints in 2019 from victims over age 60 who experienced losses of more than $835 million. Only 8% of Candoo Tech survey respondents think they are too smart to fall for a scam. ""Unfortunately, older adults are often prime targets for cyber-criminals, because they are perceived not to be tech savvy,"" said Liz Hamburg, founder and CEO of Candoo Tech. ""One client answered a call from someone posing as a Microsoft technician and let him into her computer remotely. She finally caught on when he demanded to be paid with gift cards, but by then, the damage was done. Helping seniors stay safe online is a priority for Candoo Tech."" Candoo Tech provides tech support and training specifically designed for older adults to help them stay safe, independent and connected. Candoo\'s services are provided remotely nationwide by U.S. based Tech Concierges who are specially-trained by a New York City geriatric health institution, cognitive enrichment specialists and other geriatric experts to work with older adults, including those with disabilities. Candoo Tech offers three service options: a one-hour remote session for $50; an annual membership for $180 which includes two, 90-minute training or support sessions and unlimited quick help; and a new device set-up and training package for $180. The company offers free how-to guides and internet safety tips to help seniors connect, shop and engage safely through technology.
